novels all four of these words have important meanings fantasy is the genre indicating a story with Supernatural elements epic and high are subg genres without exact definitions but generally High fantasy means a story told in an alternate or secondary world as opposed to Fantastical elements in our own world and epic in this case means a story that has the highest possible Stakes the fate of the world or the universe but I actually want to focus on this word novel novel is the form of the story we all know what what a novel is today it&#39;s by far the most popular form of literature it&#39;s a form that contains genres but it&#39;s also a genre itself with conventions that separated it from earlier genres of Literature Like medieval romance and the Epic what set the novel apart when it emerged in the 1700s was its focus on ordinary people as opposed to Knights or Noble Heroes and their engagement with contemporary culture plots became less important than characters complex flawed characters and the stories rather than take their structures from traditional genres were structured by the choices these characters made by the consequences of those choices and eventually by their inner lives their psychological conflicts with themselves now as you move backward in Time characters become grander and more archetypal embodiments of particular virtues vices and codes of Honor they&#39;re more defined by their roles in the narrative structure which is rigid and conventional take the Epic for example not to be confused with the word epic in Epic Fantasy I&#39;m talking about epics like homers ilad and odyssey Virgil&#39;s anid Beowolf or the Indian mahabarata according to genre theorist Mel Baken the Epic is set in a distant mythical past it reflects the collective memory and values of a society it&#39;s centered around the heroic Deeds of Larger than Life figures and it takes place at the founding of a culture or at a peak time most importantly epics have a sense of completeness to them what happens in an epic was always going to happen the characters are bound by fate or destiny it is as closed as a circle bakine says inside it everything is finished already over these are all qualities that describe the Lord of the Rings the story is set in an alternate world but tolken also imagined it as a mythical past for England it reflects shared values of Fellowship friendship courage and hope in the face of overwhelming dark forces it features the heroic Deeds of Larger than Life figures like Aragorn and Gandalf and it takes place at a peak time of Middle Earth the end of the third age during the war of the Ring now of course the Lord of the Rings is novelistic too most apparently in token&#39;s choice to foreground the hobbits characters who are literally not Larger than Life but whose choices have a huge impact on their world what makes tolken truly special was his ability to incorporate the qualities of Epic and myth into a modern novel and to let the reader Feel Again The Power of long dormant genres see in a world as complex and rapidly changing and scientific as ours we&#39;re not really able to write new epics and myths because well we can&#39;t believe in them we need our characters to be as complex as we are their Wills need to be free not bound by Destiny our stories need to be open not closed and yet we still yearn deeply for the completeness the unity the closed circle of Epic storytelling in fact the more complex our world becomes the stronger we feel that longing the catch is that ages that are characterized by high rates of change are eager for new myths but also ill adapted to giving themselves what they desire as Hans blumenberg said but in his fictional secondary world tolken found a loophole way for readers to satisfy their burning desire for the Epic and the Mythic without betraying their knowledge of how the world really works for me that&#39;s the value and the beauty of tolk&#39;s vision and what any adaptation should seek to capture 20 years ago I believe Peter Jackson did and that&#39;s due to his Artistry and the Artistry of everyone who worked on that trilogy but it&#39;s also because movies are able to convey this epic quality they&#39;re designed to be complete stories even when when their trilogies their endings have a finality to them they can be closed circles TV on the other hand is much more open-ended there are endings of course endings of episodes of Seasons even of series but TV shows especially those that run multiple seasons are fundamentally oriented toward the next thing not the last thing this is what makes television the ideal medium for novelistic storytelling where characters are the most important thing complex flawed characters whose choices and their consequences are what structure the story I mean all the best TV series especially TV dramas are intense character studies this is why Game of Thrones is the ideal fantasy series for TV it&#39;s a story in which Destiny plays a role but a complicated one often being misinterpreted and subverted by the messy choices of messy characters who ultimately decide their own fate TV is just not suited to capturing the Epic in tolkien&#39;s world it&#39;s not all there is in tolken but to remove it is to remove an essential piece now watching the rings of power you can see the creators trying to balance epic narrative with psychologically complex characters but when they lean into the Epic it stops being good TV it falls flat and when they lean toward the Psycho Drama it stops feeling like tolking and their job is extra extra hard because they&#39;re dealing with the second age Which is less novelistic than the Lord of the Rings even less epic in tolking these are myths where characters are even grander and more archetypal their stories more conventional trying to dive into the psychology of gadriel and Sauron for multiple seasons is a losing game now I&#39;m not rooting against the rings of power maybe they&#39;ll find a way to square the circle in season 2 maybe they won&#39;t or maybe just maybe popular IP doesn&#39;t have to be adapted and forced into every shape under the sun uh but who are we kidding they&#39;re definitely going to do that hey everybody thank you so much for watching this episode was brought to you by Squarespace the all-in-one website platform for

you&#39;ll miss it moment of camera work that is just so fascinating to me there did you see it no okay let me let me back up right here this half-second moment of pause before the camera pans to the right to follow Keanu what is that what kind of information does that communicate to the viewer in this earlier shot you can see that the camera is clearly objective and impersonal this shot on the other hand of Patrick S could conceivably be a POV of Keanu who is coming up from behind him but this shot has to be objective because no character is following here and yet this is a moment of subjectivity as if the camera itself had to think for a second before turning right it&#39;s a small thing with a big impact Bigalow uses the formal language of POV to activate a sense of immediacy in the viewer the same principle is at work in a handheld Whi pan like this it&#39;s designed to mimic the turn of a head to achieve these fast pans to enable an incredible cameraman like J Michael Muro to run at the same speed as the actors through cramped complicated environments you need a rig that is small and light that&#39;s easier said than done with a 35mm camera so Bigalow and her team created something they called the Pogo cam essentially a 35mm camera attached to a stick with a gyro stabilizer on the bottom and the results speak for themselves I mean just just look at this Bigalow is a Pioneer and virtuoso of action cinematography you can see the direct influence of this chase scene on movies like Inception the Jason Bourne movies and Casino Royale to cite just a few examples and all these films had better technology and smaller cameras my intent was to put the audience in as close to you know an experiential situation as possible in other words I wanted I wanted it all to be shot with as much sort of movement as possible you know so that you&#39;re actually feeling the velocity that those people are feeling so we had to technically figure out how to do it and how you know how to put the cameraman in the same situation as the actors are in you know giving you as realistic sense as possible the funny thing about that quote is that Bigalow is actually talking about the astonishing skydiving scene later in the movie but the sentiment applies to all her action set pieces the chase is designed to make us feel the velocity of the sprinting characters the handheld camera does that but so does the environment and the lens as a general rule a wide angle lens makes a moving image move faster and that is accentuated when you&#39;re running in tight spaces like alleys narrow streets and living rooms and constructing the chase like a maze allows Bigalow to throw all kinds of fun and dangerous obstacles at the characters don&#39;t worry that&#39;s a that&#39;s a fake dog in fact an inspiration for this Chase was the classic Disneyland ride Mr Toad&#39;s Wild Ride in which you&#39;re in a car kening recklessly through the Streets of London taking sharp turns left and right dodging pedestrians cars and other obstacles this is what Bigalow means by putting the audience in an experiential situation the chase should feel like a ride and this brings us back to POV Bigalow clearly has a fascination with the experiential power of POV shots especially moving POV shots to bring you into the action like you&#39;re sitting in that car in Mr Toad&#39;s Wild Ride later in the movie in the final bank heist Bigalow uses this tool again and puts us behind the eyes of keo&#39;s character Johnny Utah as he storms into the bank with the ex presidents but Bigalow took her experimentation with POV much further in her next film the criminally underappreciated Strange Days A cyberpunk sci-fi movie that features a technology called squid super conducting quantum interference device squid which allows you to experience other people&#39;s memories big low films these scenes entirely in POV and the film starts with an incredible 3 minute long take POV shot of a group of criminals robbing a Chinese restaurant for this sequence even the 16lb Pogo cam wasn&#39;t light enough for months in pre-production Bigalow worked with camera technicians and her ex-husband and frequent collaborator James Cameron to develop a camera that weighed just 8 lb now 8 lbs might sound a little funny today in the world of GoPros and action cameras that weigh the tiniest fraction of that these days you can get a POV of well anything YouTube is filled with firstperson parkour Chase scenes on City rooftops and povs of dogs running on the beach in 2015 Russian director Ilia ner made an entire movie in POV called hardcore Henry and then a POV music video for the weekend both of which owe a debt to the pioneering world of Catherine pigalo but even though the tech has gotten better The Point Break Chase all the action in that movie still holds up 33 years later it&#39;s just as exciting now as it was in 1991 and that will be true 33 years from now too that is if we&#39;re still watching movies on a flat screen who knows maybe all the entertainment of the future will be experienced as POV hey he everybody thank you so much for watching this episode was brought to you by

thy cold gray Stones o seea and I would that my my tongue could utter the thoughts that arise in me oh well for the fisherman&#39;s boy that he shouts with his sister at play oh well for the Sailor lad that he sings in his boat on the bay and the stately ships go on to their Haven under the hill but oh for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still break break break at the foot of thy Crags o c but the tender Grace of a day that is dead will never come back to me Alfred Lord Tennyson is the great English poet of grief which is the kind of title that nobody really wants I mean to write insightfully about loss you unfortunately need to experience it the loss that that changed the course of Tennyson&#39;s life and poetry was that of his dear friend Arthur Henry ham and I&#39;d wager that given the power Tennyson would have traded all his memorial verses and the Acclaim they brought him for just a little more time with his friend Tennison met halum in 1828 at Cambridge and they rapidly developed a deep bond the two young men loved to discuss literature and Society they traveled through Europe together and halam often visited Tennyson at his home in the village of summersby where he met and eventually became engaged to Tennyson&#39;s sister Amelia both men wanted to be poets but halam quickly realized realized that Tennyson was the genius of the two and so he worked hard to get his friends work published and into the hands of influential people in Victorian England before Tennyson had much of a reputation at all halam predicted with confidence his friend&#39;s future Prestige as he writes in an 1831 letter to Amelia many years perhaps or shall I say many ages after we&#39;ve all been laid in dust young lovers of the beautiful and the true May seek in faithful pilgrimage the spot where Alfred&#39;s mind was molded in silent sympathy with the Everlasting forms of nature critic after critic will track the wanderings of the brook or Mark the groupings of elm and popler in order to verify the o to memory in its minutest particulars in September 1833 halam was traveling with his father in Vienna when a blood vessel suddenly burst in his brain and he died while his dad was taking an evening walk he was 22 the poem I read before was written in early 1835 a little over a year after halam died it&#39;s one of many examples of Tennyson trying to process and explore his grief his greatest expression of mourning is an elegy of almost 3,000 lines called in memorium ahh for halam which took him 17 years to compose and is arguably his best work break break break on the other hand is only 16 lines but its shortness isn&#39;t a fault its brevity is its power the first stanza sets the scene and as biographer Michael Thorne notes the scene is almost cinematically clear we have the speaker standing on the shore of the sea watching the waves break on Stone as he thinks about someone who is gone the second two lines here are ambiguous they suggest either that the speaker is too sad to speak his thoughts as in he literally can&#39;t get the words out over his tears or that his thoughts are too big too strong too recent to be adequately captured in words in articulate these feelings emanate from him like waves breaking over and over on Cold gry Stones which had put us in mind of gravestones of course the irony is that this account of inarticulateness is highly articulate in the second and third stanzas the speaker turns away from the waves and observes a world that&#39;s indifferent to his desolation in fact it&#39;s a particularly happy world which provides the starkest contrast to his grief he sees young siblings at Play a young man singing in his boat and Grand ships sailing off into the Horizon but why these three images if it first they seem random a closer look shows that they&#39;ve been deliberately Chosen and deliberately ordered what you have is first a child second a youth and third stately ships representing adulthood sailing away to a far Haven which means port or Harbor as well as a safe place or Refuge if the word puts you human in Mind Of Heaven that&#39;s no coincidence what we&#39;re seeing here is the full progress of a life into death now for Tennyson the writer that was deliberate but for the speaker it may be that he was just looking around and that his grief reaching out for some articulation finds a pattern in his surroundings regardless by the end of stanza 3 he&#39;s brought back to himself his loved one may be at peace in their Haven but he&#39;s left behind and can feel nothing but absence a vanished hand a still voice in the final stanza the speaker Returns His Focus to the waves breaking against the Crags and inarticulate grief still pulsating within him and then we get this Bleak final sentence but the tender Grace of a day that is dead will never come back to me you know he&#39;s thinking about the past but this phrase day that is dead it casts a shadow back over the rest of the poem now we can&#39;t help but see these happy people as future vanished hands and still voices this happy scene as a future dead day its tender Grace irrecoverable by those who will grieve it in a sense having read Beyond these verses in the poem that scene is already gone break break break imagines grief as an incessant reaching for something that&#39;s not there as Tennison puts it in another po God gives us love something to love he lends us but when love is grown to ripeness that on which it throve falls off and love is left alone when halum died Tennyson&#39;s love for his friend was left alone but despite what break break break says he was able to transform that feeling into poetry giving form to the thoughts that arise in all who grieve in the end halam was right about his friend Tennyson&#39;s reputation is enduring and it will endure for ages to come come if only it were for a different reason hey everybody thank you so much

miniseries in 1980 the writer Eric berkovichi reframed The Source material in a significant way and I told James cell my idea which was to take his story turn it inside out and tell the whole tale of Shogun from blackthorn&#39;s point of view where we understand what he understands where we see what he sees and whenever he is confused we are equally confused to accomplish this the show ch CH not to subtitle Japanese dialogue so American audiences would be as lost as protagonist John Blackthorne a ship pilot who&#39;s based on the first Englishman to reach Japan in the year 1600 for this version of the story The subtitle choice is dramatically effective we are fully anchored in blackthorne&#39;s perspective learning as he learns feeling as he feels want to go in there of course what you lose by this framing is the interiority of all the characters who speak only Japanese and for an epic set in Japan about an important period in Japanese history the loss is a big one clell&#39;s novel definitely has that Stranger in a Strange Land element Blackthorne is still the protagonist after all but it also lets us into the minds and conversations of the Japanese characters which is what fx&#39;s Stellar 2024 remake of the Shogun miniseries does as well instead of just one focal character Shogun 2024 has multiple most of which are Japanese and all their dialogue is subtitled this Choice does make the viewer less confused than Blackthorne but it doesn&#39;t downplay the sense of East Meets West culture shock it just balances it what&#39;s made this new series so compelling to me is how it uses the Act of translation to explore the possibilities and limitations of communication across cultures and communication period how do I say I understand in your language when Blackthorne arrives in Japan his first translator is a Japanese Catholic who knows very little Portuguese which is spoken as English on this show and it&#39;s significant here at the beginning that Blackthorne asks how to say I understand Shogun is very interesting as we&#39;ll see in the difference or the gap between simple translation and understanding his second translator is a Portuguese Catholic priest who speaks broken Japanese once he finds out that Blackthorne is an English Protestant he refuses to translate honestly instead of communicating black Thorn&#39;s words the priest communicates the meaning of black Thorn&#39;s presence to him unable to speak for himself Blackthorne closes the language with a gesture not be spoken for by Catholics blackthorn&#39;s first proper translator is another Catholic priest who honestly relays his words to Lord taga in order to ensure this honesty taga invites another translator lady Maro who also knows Japanese and Portuguese the show communicates the faithfulness of this translation to us by gradually removing the translators until taga seems to be directly speaking to Blackthorne and here&#39;s the advantage to using subtitles Shogun 2024 is able to show a true meaning of the minds between two focal characters who speak different languages my Lord would like to say that he is sorry for the time you spent in prison later in the same episode lady Maro becomes blackthorne&#39;s primary translator I&#39;m grateful to be alive and what&#39;s interesting is how she suly Alters the conversation I hope your time in prison wasn&#39;t too difficult doesn&#39;t necessarily suggest an apology and I&#39;m grateful to be alive doesn&#39;t necessarily suggest thanks Miko adds these sentiments quietly controlling the tone of the exchange till this milk dribbling [\u00a0__\u00a0] me I&#39;m ready to go this is a role Miko continues to play most dramatically in episode five during a dinner scene with her husband bonaro Blackthorn and blackthorn&#39;s consort Fuji Miko attempts to smooth out the aggression between the two men by changing their language my husband comments on the way you eat your noodles the sand you make while eating reveals the depth of your pleasure if you look at the 1980 version of the scene Miko still translates but we&#39;re blocked from bonaro and Fuji&#39;s words so we have to take her translation at face value in the 2024 version with subtitles we get a riveting scene of dramatic irony where the translation itself becomes significant a mediation between the interplay of four Minds in trying to avoid conflict Maro is faced with translating cultural values as well as language and that&#39;s not easy when Blackthorne ask buaro for War Stories he&#39;s communicating a positive English value for boasting that buaro considers vulgar and rude those three words carry far more meaning than their basic definitions and this isn&#39;t the episode&#39;s only mistranslation of three words when Blackthorne receives a pheasant from taga he hangs it outside his house to quote unquote mature and tells his household off the cuff eventually the Pheasant rots its stench disturbs the piece of the neighborhood and the kindly old Gardener finally takes it down at the cost of his life what have you done depending on the context the same work words can carry wildly different meanings you put that old man to death over stinking God cursed pheasant to translate the correct meaning requires a deep familiarity with the two languages and the cultures that created them go away you know I don&#39;t believe that true translation is impossible I don&#39;t believe communication between cultures is impossible and I don&#39;t think Shogun believes that either but translation means more than a relaying of words words and the show wants us to think about that after all Blackthorne isn&#39;t the only English speaker being translated to here so are we the English-speaking audience shogun&#39;s Japanese dialogue was actually written in English carefully translated into Japanese into period specific phrasing then carefully translated back into English to be consumed by us in the form of subtitles the show Runners spend a lot of time and resources on this clearly but I can&#39;t help but wonder about the that I&#39;m missing the fact that I&#39;m even thinking about that means the show is doing its job you know translation is usually something that creators of film and TV try to avoid at all costs it takes up a lot of precious time with unnecessary repetition shun 2024 has found a way to make translation a central theme of the show and the act of translation into gripping television this is not in our Lord&#39;s interest I&#39;m sorry were you

of the first book that Jane Austin ever published since insensibility she did something that changed fiction forever the narrator of the book begins by describing the situation of the dashwood family John dashwood has come into a big inheritance from his father Henry who on his deathbed makes John promise to take care of his three half sisters when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of ,000 a piece he then really thought himself equal to it the prospect of 4,000 a year made him feel capable of generosity yes he would give them \u00a33,000 it would be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make them completely easy \u00a33,000 he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did not repent so what stands out in this passage which of these things is not like the rest well it&#39;s this part here before this the the narrator is describing the thoughts and feelings of John dashwood but in the highlighted section something changes it&#39;s suddenly as if we&#39;re inside Jon&#39;s mind and yet the point of view doesn&#39;t change we&#39;re still in the third person now Austin could have reported Jon&#39;s thoughts directly here writing I will give them \u00a33,000 or I can spare so considerable a sum but she doesn&#39;t instead she does something new in English literature what&#39;s called free indirect speech now Austin isn&#39;t the first to use thisch technique but she&#39;s the first author to do so consistently the first to really explore its possibilities and in the process she effectively adds a new tool to the writer&#39;s toolbox but why what is free indirect style good for why not just use direct thought well if you&#39;re familiar with Jane Austin you know that all of her books have a really strong narratorial voice the narrator has full control over the story painting a universe of manners making witty sides to the reader and using irony to critique characters and social conventions to accomplish her goals Austin needed her narrator to have critical distance from the story but this ironic distance has the potentially negative side effect of distancing the characters from The Reader I mean she still needs us to be emotionally involved with these people after all free indirect speech is Austin&#39;s intuitive and revolutionary solution for having it both ways okay let&#39;s look at another subtler example from Emma as matchmaking Title Character thinks about the suitability of Mr Elton for her friend Harriet Smith the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency Mr elton&#39;s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connections he had a comfortable home for her and Emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of hbur was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good humored well-meaning respectable young man like the first passage this one begins firmly in the first person narratorial voice with she considered and her sense then in the second sentence it seamlessly switches to free indirect speech and we&#39;re inside Emma&#39;s mind which you can tell by phrasing like most suitable and quite the gentleman after this it starts to get tricky Austin begins to weave in and out a free indirect speech within individual sentences the narrator returns with phrases like Emma imagined and she thought and as critic Daniel gun points out this return and the distance it creat reminds us to be wary of Emma&#39;s judgments and imaginings but then we slip right back into her spirit again her subjectivity in Clauses like a goodh humored well-meaning respectable young man in Emma especially Austin uses free indirect speech with extraordinary finesse dipping in and out of several Minds without ever interrupting the flow of narration representing subjectivities as dun says with great immediacy while still providing a frame within which that subject ity can be understood at the end of the novel we get the amazing convergence of these two voices as Emma&#39;s self-deception becomes self- knowledge as her inner voice finally aligns with what the narrator and the reader have seen all along free IND direct speech is a formal Innovation that changed the course of literature now it&#39;s impossible to say who Austin influenced directly but she effectively created a tool that thousands and thousands of authors used and still use including some of the most famous ever like George Elliott Henry James James Joyce and Virginia wolf unlike these other authors Jane Austin is often belittled for her seemingly lightweight marriage comedies but that critique misses the complex formal dynamics that are working under the surface if you really want to see Austin&#39;s genius you have to look deeper you have to

Cicero Cicero was a new man so he&#39;s someone who didn&#39;t have famous ancestors um so he was a disadvantage and I think CIS is really interesting for a couple reasons one is he wrote an incredible amount I think we have almost more words from Cicero than any other author that survive and it&#39;s all kinds of stuff it&#39;s philosophical is it&#39;s books about how to be a good public speaker he published you know volume after volume of his personal letters to his friends he published these things um so there&#39;s tons of stuff from him and secondly he&#39;s interesting because he lived at this incredibly important time in the late Republic when things were falling apart but he seems to have been born with none of the natural advantages that all these other people had so he was a lousy General uh he didn&#39;t come from a wealthy family he didn&#39;t come from a famous aristocratic family um you know he didn&#39;t have a lot of these advantages but yet he ended up being right at the center of things Rose to the highest elected office in the Roman State on the basis of one skill and that was his ability with words his ability to get up in front of a crowd and persuade them of what he wanted them to believe an oratory public speaking was absolutely Central to life at Rome there were just all these events where people had to get get up and and give speeches so in courtrooms at funerals um you know in the Senate uh to the people of Rome um at games I mean just constantly there are these opportunities for giving speeches so if you were good at this that was a huge uh advantage in your political career and Cicero was the best he was arguably the best public speaker of all time some people claim um and he lived right in this era and he parlayed that skill with words into this very successful political career he was one of the guys involved with all this stuff with Caesar and pompy and all the other things going on Octavia Mark Anthony and you&#39;ve uh you&#39;ve written which is fascinating it&#39;s fascinating when The Echoes of people from a distant past are seen today the same stuff is seen today not just like some of the the beautiful legal stuff that we&#39;ve been talking about but the the the tricks the the you know let&#39;s say the the the shitty stuff we see in politics so many of the iCal tricks you wrote such as mudslinging exaggeration Gil by association and homm attacks name calling fear-mongering us versus them rhyme and so on and so forth so I&#39;m guessing it worked given that we still have those today yeah I mean one of the things ciso did is he wrote at least three of these sort of handbooks about how to be a good public speaker so we know a lot about that um we have his own speeches that survive and then we have later people after ciso who wrote about what ciso did too so we know a lot about what he did and the key to Cicero&#39;s whole Enterprise about persuading an audience let&#39;s say either it a speech to the people or in the courtroom is ciso believed that people are fundamentally ruled by emotion MH so if you can touch their emotions all sorts of other things become less important if you can get a jury emotionally worked up and fear anger are particularly powerful there then the facts might not matter the truth might not matter evidence might not matter uh reason might not matter emotion is the key to everything so Cicero used what I would arguably call a lot of tricks to get his audiences emotionally riled up and you can just go through these and they&#39;re all the stuff you were saying you know name calling um you know U mudslinging Us Versus Them arguments um you know add homonym attacks um I mean incredibly sophisticated all the stuff that we think of today is oh very sophisticated techniques for um you know propaganda and persuasion it&#39;s not new PE people are aren&#39;t coming up with that much that&#39;s new outside the realm of Technology human nature is the same Cicero understood human psychology he knew how to play on people he knew how to play on their emotions and he would do just I mean I want to say hilarious but there sort of depressingly hilarious things like uh he thought it&#39;s important to use props so he said you know people are visual uh they will respond emotionally to visual things in a way that just words alone won&#39;t work so he says uh an order is just like an actor and like an actor he has to prepare his stage and use props and and you know things as um you know visual cues to stir up the audience so for example once he was defending a man in a court case who had just had a new baby born to him and Cicero literally delivered the defense oration for this guy while cradling his newborn son in his arms and you know you can imagine oh cute little baby jury how could you find him guilty and leave this cute baby without a father to take care of him um another time he was defending a guy who had a photogenic son a kind of a young boy and cisero literally propped up the kid behind him while he was giving the speech and again said look at his eyes brimming with tears thinking about his father you know being punished how could you leave this wonderful boy without you know a father to care for him another time someone didn&#39;t have photo kids so he poed up his old parents in the courtroom and said look at this nice old couple you won&#39;t want to take their son away um you know that kind of stuff I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s manipulative um cico by the way I should say also had um philosophical beliefs about defending the Republic and such but he wasn&#39;t above using these things so even though he may have had altruistic or high Notions of you know uh what he was doing he also wasn&#39;t above using these kind of rhetorical tricks and also you mentioned to me that you studied the gestures they used like this is one of those like on the theme of extremely interesting details of life this was actually my uh dissertation and it was my first book well that&#39;s amazing is again I tell you I like practical stuff and this all started with I kept reading about people like Cicero giving speeches okay in ancient Rome lots of speeches and they would give a speech in the Forum with 10 20,000 people and the thought occurred to me well ancient Rome you don&#39;t have microphones you don&#39;t have loudspeakers so how does someone give a speech outdoors in a windy place not acoustically sound to 20,000 people they just can&#39;t hear you and the answer part of the answer turns out part of it&#39;s oratorical training you learn how to project your voice but some of it too is that the Romans actually had this system of gestures that orders like ciso would use to accompany their speeches and what I ended up doing is combining two types of evidence again so I looked at the rhetorical handbooks like cisos and also there&#39;s this guy quintilian who lived about U 100 years after Cicero who wrote this long thing called The Institute your oratoria which has a description of all types of oratorical stuff including about 40 pages on gestures so he actually says when you put your fingers like this it means such and such and it turns out Roman orders had a system of sign language that they would use to augment their speeches but here&#39;s the fun part it wasn&#39;t like modern American Sign Language where a gesture means the same thing as a word instead and this goes back to ciso a certain gesture would indicate a certain emotion that you were meant to feel when you heard the words so it&#39;s like your body is adding an emotional gloss to your speech you&#39;re saying words and then you&#39;re indicating how you think those words should make you feel and even more fun the Romans believed that if I make certain hand gestures you will almost involuntarily feel certain emotions so if you&#39;re skilled you can manipulate your Audience by playing on their emotions and this might sound you know kind of weird or improbable but the metaphor that Cicero himself uses is he says think about music everybody knows that certain musical tones will make you feel a certain way so you know think of movies today in a horror movie you know they&#39;re going to play strident tense music in a ro antic scene you&#39;re going to have strings and it&#39;ll make you feel a certain way when you hear the Jaws theme you feel tense right CIS said the &#39;s body is like a liar a liar is a musical instrument and you have to learn to play on your own body as a musical instrument to affect the emotions of your audience I think he might be on to something especially given how Central Public Speaking was to in Roman culture and a lot of the Roman oratorical gestures like I could probably do some and you could probably guess what emotion they&#39;re meant to be so for example there&#39;s one where like you hold up your hands to the side and kind of push like this so this is the gesture and what that means is kind of mild aversion I don&#39;t like something now if I couple this with turning my face to the to the side like that so pushing off to one side turning my face away it&#39;s a strong aversion that&#39;s like fear or something if I clench my fist and press it to my chest that&#39;s anger or grief if I slap my thigh again that&#39;s an indication of anger so a lot of these makes sense I mean they&#39;re kind of natural gestures now some are really weird and artificial um I mean one my favorite of these is if you like hold your hand up uh open and then curl the fingers in one by one and then flip it out so uh this sort of thing that to the Romans meant Wonder um which you sort of see but again if you&#39;ve been raised in a societal context where you&#39;re used to the notion that this gesture means this emotion when someone does it you&#39;re probably going to feel that tion it&#39;s like memes today if it becomes viral you know what it&#39;s supposed to me and has power I mean and it&#39;s actually interesting that we don&#39;t use gestures as much in modern day well I mean for me I I just love analyzing modern political figures in terms of their body language yes um because how you deliver a speech is often more important than what you say uh in fact in the ancient world uh the most famous Greek oror was a guy named demosthenes um and once a guy came up to deases and said deases tell me what are the three most important things in giving a speech and deasi said well they are delivery delivery and delivery that even the most brilliant speech if accompanied by a boring delivery is going to be less effective than a terrible speech given in an engaging and exciting or funny way speaking of modern day and gestures what do you think of um uh Donald Trump who has these very unique kind of gestures I think there&#39;s uh I don&#39;t know to degree to is true but he kind of uses these handshakes when he pulls people in that kind of stuff what what do you make of that I mean Trump gesticulates a lot but it&#39;s a fairly narrow set of gestures I mean if you watch him for a bit he kind of has the same small set of gestures and they&#39;re not I want to say they&#39;re not natural in that they&#39;re not kind of illustrating what he&#39;s saying it&#39;s more just punctuation points I think of his as more kind of these punctuation points for just going along with what he&#39;s saying there are speakers who truly can use their hands and arms and faces creatively um and you watch them and it&#39;s really enhancing the speech um I mean just historically uh you know Martin Luther King he&#39;s famous for a lot of good speeches content he was a good gesticulator too um he knew how to use his body on the other hand Adolf Hitler was a phenomenal gesticulator if you watch some of his speeches even just like turn off the sound and watch them he&#39;s doing all kinds of stuff and he&#39;s really emphasizing his points in a very creative way and this is what&#39;s fascinating about oratory and public speaking is it&#39;s this two-edged sword you can use these techniques for good or you can absolutely use them for evil you know yeah um so the very same techniques in the hands of you know MLK you say this is wonderful this is fantastic in the hands of Hitler you say this is awful look he&#39;s persuading a nation to commit atrocities I encourage people to watch the species of Hitler the oratory skill there to be able to channel uh the resentment and the frustration of a people and uh control it and direct it any direction he wants yes through speaking alone yeah it&#39;s the visual embodiment of the words where he&#39;s talking about you know V R Germany being taken advantage of supposedly and all this stuff um you&#39;re right he&#39;s channeling the resentment uh of the people and and using that to his personal advantage and and for cynical uh evil really purposes um but orator is like that you know it&#39;s the question I always end up asking my students is after studying uh Cicero and all these techniques I say okay this is great oratory but do you like this is this good that this works on human beings uh I remember kn chsky once was asked why do you speak in such a monotone way and he said well I want the truth of my statement the contents of my statements to speak that uh I don&#39;t want you to uh get deluded by me because I&#39;m such a charismatic and eloquent speaker uh the more monotone I speak the more you will listen to the content of the words right I want you just focusing on the content and not being distracted I&#39;ll tell you also with ciso uh one of the things that he and other uh people who write about Roman oratory do is to say and can do this stuff badly in which case it backfires horribly so you can have people who attempt to gesticulate again modern politicians you&#39;ll see this sometime where they feel like I&#39;m supposed to be making hand gestures and they&#39;re terrible at it and it undercuts it and and ciso and quenan giv some very amusing examples from ancient Rome so like he says there was this one guy who when he spoke looked like he was trying to swat away flies you know because there were just these awkward gestures or another who looked like he was trying to balance in a boat like in a in you know choppy seas and my favorite is there was one order who supposedly was prone to making I guess kind of languid Supple motions and so they actually named a dance after this guy and his name was uh tidious and so Romans could do the tedious which is this dance that was imitating this order who had these you know kind of comically bad uh gesticulation so not enough gesticulation is a problem too much gesticulation is a problem problem you have to hit the sweet spot it has to seem natural it has to seem varied uh it has to conform to the meaning of the words not distract from it yeah natural to your like authentic to who you are which is uh when people try to copy the gestur of another person it usually doesn&#39;t go well you have to kind of uh yeah you have to interpret integrate into your own personality and so on but gestures is is a really fun it&#39;s fast so I I I enjoyed my dissertation a lot doing that because what I was trying to do there was to lit Al reconstruct them so to say what were the actual gestures and I did that by comparing uh the literary accounts of the handbooks with again Roman art looking at statues of Romans and things and just trying to say okay what what were some of the gestures they actually used here and and in that way the people from that time come to life in your mind and your work which is is fasc it&#39;s this pragmatic thing I want to know okay how does this work for""}, {""title"": ""Donald Trump's hand gestures | Gregory Aldrete and Lex Fridman"", ""description"": ""Lex Fridman Podcast full episode:

across centuries for spectacle watching people fight and you like you said you know only like 10% of the time it led to the death but I read that still a lot of a lot of people died a lot of glad AED were killed oh yeah those numbers are just crazy I mean I I read uh 400,000 dead so this includes Gladiators slaves convicts prisoners and and so on that&#39;s a lot of people the the Flaming ampath is really interesting too just as a piece of technology and as influence on later world I mean almost every sporting Arena today owes something to the flavan amphithe the coliseum in terms of construction and it was amazingly sophisticated building I mean it had you know retractable awnings and elevators and ramps that things could just pop up into the arena From Below and um you know it had very well-designed passages where everybody could file in and file out very efficiently and they were all numbered so I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s one of I think the most influential buildings in history uh just because of the way that you know all these buildings we go to today they&#39;re all kind of variant on it and using some of the ideas from it and the Romans took their construction seriously oh yeah they were good at that so they were excellent Engineers um and and the Romans were excellent Engineers especially when it came to what you might think of as humble stuff I mean today we tend to think of oh a Roman building is shining White marble right well the core of that building was probably concrete and the marble is just a superficial facade and if you think about the Coliseum in Rome today all the marble has been stripped off that building and what you see is the concrete core the structural core that&#39;s left and the Romans I mean they didn&#39;t invent concrete but they just used it more creatively than anyone had before and if you look at buildings like the Greeks bu they&#39;re all rect linear they&#39;re all rectangles or squares and they always have a lot of columns because you need to hold the roof up the Romans because of their use of concrete could build wooden frames they could have curves they could have domes they could have all kinds of stuff and it just explodes the architectural possibilities they also made a lot of use of the The Vault so if you cut rocks and arrange them so they form a curve you could have big vaed spaces um and they were just brilliant with their mix of things I mean the pantheon is the best preserved Roman building and it&#39;s another brilliant building incredibly influential I mean every every capital building in the world or museum is is an imitation of the pantheon you know the capital in Washington DC uh the capital in Madison I&#39;m I&#39;m from Wisconsin Austin where we are now they&#39;re all pantheons um you know it&#39;s a big dome with a triangular pediment and some columns on the front um so it&#39;s just amazingly influential building but it&#39;s brilliant because the way it&#39;s constructed is you know the the concrete at the bottom of the Dome is both thicker and has a denser formulation so it&#39;s heavier where it needs to Bear the weight and then as you get further up the Dome it gets narrower and narrower and they mix in different types of rock so at the top you&#39;re using pumis that very light volcanic Stone so where you want it to be light it&#39;s light and it&#39;s here 2,000 years later I mean look around you how many buildings that were building now do you think are going to be here in 2,000 years um I suspect not many and it&#39;s not only that they lasted but they were beautiful or at least in our current conception of beauty yeah I mean you know vitrus you know his principles are things should be functional and they should be aesthetically pleasing so that that that&#39;s a winning combination I think yeah they pulled that off pretty well""}, {""title"": ""Roman military tactics explained: Heavy infantry vs cavalry |

of it in the ancient world the ancient world sort of from the Greeks through the Romans there&#39;s this um consistent line of focusing on heavy infantry so going back to Greece when they&#39;re fighting let&#39;s say Persia which at the time was the superpower of the ancient world and vastly richer vastly larger than ancient Greece you know tons more men but the Persians tended to be archers tended to be light Horsemen tended to be light infantry whereas the Greeks specialized in what are called hotlights which is a kind of infantry men with very heavy body armor uh a helmet a spear and a really big heavy shield and they would get in that formation where you kind of make the shields overlap and just form this solid Mass bristling with spear points and just slowly kind of March forward and grind up your enemy in front of you and so that&#39;s that sort of block of heavy infantry the advantage is head on against other things they tend to win the disadvantage is it&#39;s slow moving um it&#39;s vulnerable from the sides and the rear so you got to protect those um but if you can keep frontally faced it it&#39;s pretty much invincible and that&#39;s taken even further by Alexander the Great who comes up with the idea well what if we even give them a longer spear so Greek Spears were 68 ft long uh Alexander the Great arms his armies with the Sissa which is this 15t almost a pike this extra long Spear and so when the spear is that long you don&#39;t even hardly need the shields anymore so it&#39;s just this incredibly powerful thing in frontal attack and that&#39;s what he uses to make himself ruler of the known world he goes and conquers the Persian Empire and makes himself the Persian king of kings with this uh failan of troops armed with the cissa so that&#39;s very power F the Romans go a little bit different route they have heavy infantry but they focus more on fighting with short swords so it&#39;s get up close and kind of stab and the other thing the Romans do is they focus on um flexibility and subdividing their army so Alexander&#39;s faank was a mass of let&#39;s say 5,000 guys and it was one unit the Roman army is organized in an Ever decreasing number of subunits so you have a group of eight guys who are a con tuia the men who share a tent you take 10 of those and they form a century of 80 men you take a bunch of those and you form a cohort you you get a bunch of those you form a legion so the Romans are able to subdivide their army and the big sticking point comes at 197 BC at the Battle of kinos when the Roman legion goes up against um one of the descendants of Alexander the Great who&#39;s using his military system so this is the new Roman system with flexibility versus the old Invincible Alexander system with the heavily armed Sissa with those long 15-t poles and the key moment the battle is where they lock together and in a head-on Clash the the macedonians are going to win but the Romans have the flexibility to break off

feature to stories how will you measure if this is successful hi everyone we&#39;re here today with aova for another data science mock interview thanks so much for being here with us today aova can you quickly introduce yourself for our viewers yeah sure hi everyone I&#39;m a data scientist in a tech company and prior to my current company I worked at instacart and Amazon as a data scientist awesome right so I&#39;m excited to hear your insights on today&#39;s question if you&#39;re enjoying this video you can watch dozens more of videos like this at triexcitons over a million people use exponent to Ace their interviews in product management software engineering Engineering Management machine learning data science and much much more get started for free at trixon all right so our question today is you work in a social media company and the product manager wants to test adding a new reaction feature to stories how will you measure if this is successful um so I think first I think first of all running an experiment is probably the best way to test if such a change is successful um and I&#39;ll follow an experiment framework for that so I think as the first step I want to spend some time on defining the problem more clearly and also asking some clarification questions to sort of different find find the problem scope better um so I think my first question is why is this adding this new feature or this experiment why is it important for the company like what decisions will this help Drive uh well I&#39;d actually love to hear like your insights on this can you imagine like why it would be useful to run this experiment like from a product perspective yeah sure so I think um thinking about about this feature um I think by introducing this new reaction feature users will probably be more engaged with stories um they&#39;ll probably interact if they use if they like using this feature they&#39;ll probably interact more um with their connections and that should also lead them to being more engaged with the app in general like they might also create more stories just to use this reaction feature for example and eventually that should lead to them being more connected with their friends and connections as well as spending more time on the app in general and I think this ties well with the primary mission of most social media companies which is typically to improve connection among people and sort of like bring the world closer together so so I think it makes sense that adding this new feature that increases user engagement would be important for the company yeah that definitely sounds like a a familiar motivation for many social media companies um so it sounds like you&#39;re focusing mostly on user engagement then yeah okay perfect um I do have a few more sort of clarifying questions about how exactly this new reaction feature is being implemented so first of all how will this show up in the users app like will they know about it and does it change the user workflow in anyway so in general it shouldn&#39;t change the workflow too much like basically the new reaction will show up in the existing user reactions menu but um users for whom this feature is for whom this new feature is available will get a notification telling them about it when they first open the app so that&#39;s basically the only new thing okay um okay yeah that makes sense um then I also want to ask is this feature meant for all users like for example I think on most social media platforms I can think of two types of users like one could be regular users who have a connection of friends or followers and usually it&#39;s sort of mutual like if you&#39;re following someone they&#39;re also most likely following you back but then there&#39;s also another type of user which is more like a celebrity user where they may have a lot of followers but they probably don&#39;t follow as many people back so is this reaction feature meant for both of these types of users or do you is it or do you think it&#39;s better to focus on one of these types of users and also in terms of is are there any restrictions on app versions or platforms uh yeah so right now you can assume that we&#39;re not putting any restrictions on the type of users that this feature will be available to so no restrictions on specific like app versions or platforms or user segments however I am interested in hearing your insights about how we might assess like the impact of this new feature for different user segments later on yeah I think as I mentioned I feel like um if the since we&#39;ve said that the objective is to sort of bring users together and lead to higher engagement I think it&#39;s the regular users who will probably get more benefit from this app because I think with celebrities it&#39;s probably maybe like more of a one-way interaction and also right um like yeah like regular users may not even interact too much with on Celebrity stories so yeah I think I would definitely sort of look at these two user groups separately with more of a focus on the on the regular user right okay so that sounds like um a good thing to look into later on but before we get into that I&#39;d love to hear if you have ideas about what kinds of metrics you want to measure yeah um sorry I&#39;m just writing down some notes no worries take your time um yeah so I think for metrics there are basically four categories of metrics uh which I would want to look at so that&#39;s the Northstar metric um which is sort of like a longer term success metric um which ties which should tie to the overall company&#39;s goals which in this case would be engagement or user connectivity then we have the primary success metric which is sort of a more immediate metric which can help us more directly measure the impact of this new reaction feature um then there&#39;s secondary metrics or first guardrail metrics which are basically metrics which we want to make sure we don&#39;t inadvertently hurt and then finally the fourth category is secondary metrics which are basically if we&#39;re interested in learning some like or helping understand some secondary questions about this feature we can think of some metrics to measure in that category so I&#39;ll just go through each of these categories and maybe Define one to two key metrics in each category do you think that&#39;s that&#39;s a reasonable approach okay perfect yeah let&#39;s list them out okay yeah I&#39;ll just also write this down yeah so for the NSTAR metric um for notstar metric I think overall user engagement um is probably like the most relevant NSTAR metric here because we want to basically make sure that by introducing this feature we are actually improving overall user engagement since that&#39;s sort of the ultimate goal of adding this feature and I think one common way to measure that it&#39;s is minutes spent on the app um and the time period could be different based on what based on historical data we have about app usage but I think for social media apps usually people do use them pretty much every day so I think a daily basis a daily metric for minute spent um would be a good one for the NSTAR we can also look at daily active users um because again if this feature works as expected then it might users might be sort of like more willing to log into the app um just to sort of use this feature more so yeah so those are the two I would use for notar yeah and just uh to clarify what classifies a user as being a daily active user oh yeah that&#39;s a good question I think usually if a user logs into the app we would consider that as an active user um but of course the if I mean maybe certain social media companies have more specific definitions of what they consider a daily active user like for example maybe you have to spend at least 5 minutes on the browsing on the app or something like that so that would probably that&#39;s something I would probably sort of like discuss with other data scientist or see what the standard definition is is for the company okay sure that makes sense then for primary success metric as I mentioned I think this is something which we want to be able to measure the impact of the actual feature in a more direct way so in this case I think the reaction usage rate could be a good feature or sorry a good metric and I think how I would Define this is number of stories with a reaction divided by the number of stories viewed because basically if we&#39;ve improved this reaction feature now we should see a higher usage rate for like basically we should see more stories with a reaction uh being used so that&#39;s why I think this is like a pretty direct metric I think we since we are introducing a new reaction we would also be interested in the new reaction specifically like what the adoption rate for the new reaction is so this would just I I guess here we do have Baseline like we probably have a baseline of how often the other existing reactions are being used so we could compare this new reaction adoption rate with existing ones to see if it&#39;s performing better where or more similar okay so is that basically the same thing as comparing the new reaction adoption rate with the reaction usage rate that you listed before yeah sort of I guess just that the if we want to be even more granular because say we have like three or four existing reactions they might have different existing usage rates as well so now we add a fifth one you want to break it down okay so yeah so basically number of times that I would measure as number of times new reaction was used um and I think here the denominator should probably be number of um number of times user clicked on the react button say basically this is just to reduce noise so that we don&#39;t include users who never even like clicked on the reaction button okay and this this is a better way to compare with existing reaction as well or existing reaction usage rates as well um and I think we would also be interested at a user level so on on average um like how many users are using these new reactions when they&#39;re viewing a story so and I&#39;ll talk I think we can discuss more about the granular like which level the metric should be measured at when we discuss the randomization as well but I&#39;m just making a note that apart from like a system level metric um I think we would also be interested at a user level and then finally I think one of my my hypothesis is also that if this new reaction is very interesting or appealing to users they may actually even create more stories just to be able to use this reaction or to see if their friends are using this reaction so I that could also be this could actually also be a secondary metric but but yeah basically I think this is also something interesting to measure um then I think for guardrail I think um overall reaction rate I think should be a guard drill as well so even though I guess it is a primary success but it is actually actually a guardrail as well because we want to make sure that by introducing this new reaction we&#39;re not hurting existing usage okay um and I think then also like more from a technical implementation for example if this new reaction is leading to crashes or some other type of undesirable um user experience which causes users to abandon the workflow for example we do want to make sure that monitoring that as well so I think some sort of a crash rate um or and a bounce rate metric would be good ones to measure for guardrail I think latency might be another good one because sometimes it&#39;s possible that there could be like additional calls being made on the back end for this new reaction which maybe makes the entire uh app experience lower right yeah that could be a careful tradeoff and then finally for secondary metrics I think one interesting one could be repeated usage of this new reaction so other than um I guess measuring at an overall user level or system level I think it would also be interesting to see if the same set of users are using this new feature multiple times or is it more like they&#39;re only using it once or twice um I think another interesting one here would be the notification engagement rate since you mentioned that the first time they open the app they will get a notification so I think just seeing like are users even like looking at the notification or after the notification are they actually going trying in looking at the new reaction like basically trying out the feature um I think those could be interesting secondary metrics because I think that just tells us like is the not is a notification the best way to users about new features um or maybe we can try other things there as well if we find that a lot of users are just ignoring the notification right and I guess it helps you disentangle between the effects of the notification versus the new feature itself sorry um yeah that makes sense because I guess it helps you disentangle between the effects of the notification versus the feature itself yeah so I think that&#39;s uh does that seem like a reasonable set of metrics yeah totally okay so yeah I think now moving on to the actual experiment design I think as I mentioned the randomization unit I think for this experiment in particular is pretty important because and I think this is true for a lot of um new features especially when it comes to social media apps or Networks is that if you have a user who&#39;s in the treatment Group which means they do have this new feature this new reaction but if in their Network some users are not in treatment which means if if we randomize at a user level then it&#39;s possible that um there could be some friends or followers in your network who don&#39;t have the new reaction and that could lead to sort of like weird inconsistencies where like maybe you send the reaction to them but they actually don&#39;t see it or something like that and that also violates one of the key um principles of experimentation which is the Sutra principle or the Sutra assumption which basically stands for stable unit treatment variance assumption and basically what one of the conditions for that is um users and treatment there or the experience of users in treatment shouldn&#39;t be affected by whether other users are in treatment or control but in this case because multiple users are connected together um it that viol that assumption is actually violated and that can lead to biased results so that&#39;s why I think in this case we can&#39;t really randomize it at a user level okay yeah that&#39;s a pretty important consideration because we have like so many Network effects here yeah and so I think there&#39;s two alternate ways of randomization that I can think of um I think the first one is maybe randomizing at a at like a geographical Market level so for example what that could look like is we have one set of markets where everybody who&#39;s in those markets gets this new feature so that&#39;s sort of like the treatment group and then there&#39;s a similar group of markets where everyone who&#39;s in those markets gets is in control but I think there are a few problems with this approach first of all finding those similar markets could can be quite difficult because like for example the US market is probably pretty different from most other markets in the world and that that&#39;s true for like most countries then secondly it could also be that these days especially people travel quite a lot so if we use like IP address for example as a way to to put them in treatment or control that could also like potentially mess up things if people are like traveling between control and treatment countries like it&#39;s possible that um yeah that again they might have inconsistent they might see inconsistencies in their in their user experience and then finally this would restrict the sample size and therefore the power a lot because there there are only so many markets in the world so so that&#39;s why I think a better approach randomization approach here is to do some sort of clustering based randomization where basically we create we can create user clusters so in one cluster for example all users and whoever is in the network they would be in treatment or control um and so we can create like a bunch of user clusters for treatment in treatment and a bunch of user clusters in control I think this takes care of most of the issues I mentioned with with Jo randomization right okay with one of the main ones being that uh users that are connected to each other might be in different countries right yeah so in this case I think we&#39;re basically making sure that as long as you&#39;re in one of the treatment clusters everybody in your network it also has the new feature um effect I think when it comes to triggering criteria like the most straightforward one is to just assign them to the experiment when they first open the app um but that could still they could still be some noise from users who actually maybe they don&#39;t even have any stories available to view like for example if there&#39;s like a new user who doesn&#39;t have too many friends or connections and none of their friends or connections supposed to the story then they actually wouldn&#39;t be able to use this feature at all so that&#39;s why if we want to reduce noise or variance a little bit more we could also trigger only basic trigger that is assigned them to the experiment only if their homepage actually has stories available to view I think that I would discuss with Engineers because sometimes it might be too much of a technical lift to do that so I think it&#39;s a tradeoff between basically like data science spending more time on an is and variance reduction techniques versus the engineering lift required to have this more selective triggering CR yeah it&#39;s a good consideration can you tell me a little bit more in detail about how that assignment happens when the user first logs in yeah so I think if you just go go with the first login criteria then as soon as they first login the backend system would randomly either assign them to treatment or control and then they&#39;re assigned to treatment they would have access to this new feature and so they would see the new notification for example and then once they&#39;re assigned they sort of stay in that in whatever control group whatever variant they&#39;re assigned to for the rest of the experiment right I guess my question was more about so people different people log in at different times right so let&#39;s say the user logs in for like the first time in a few days but somebody in their network has already been assigned to either the control group or the treatment group so then you can&#39;t really Rand randomizes users assignment right yeah in that case then they would be assigned to uh like whatever cluster they&#39;re already in so I think so I think yeah in that case that&#39;s how that would work okay uh whatever cluster they&#39;re already in is which one exactly so in this case if there somebody in their network is already so basically I think their assignment would happen as soon as like one person in your network is assigned so for example if you&#39;re logging in and say like nobody in your network is assigned to the experiment yet I think at that point you could be randomly assigned to either control or treatment but as long as there&#39;s one and then you&#39;re basically in one of the Clusters like you&#39;ve created a new cluster at that point but then any everybody else in who is in your cluster or will Bas or in your network will basically also be assigned to the same cluster as you okay great so you&#39;re saying that the assignment actually happens not at the time at which the user first logs in but at the time at which anybody in their cluster first logs in yeah yeah that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a good point okay yeah sounds good yeah moving on to the to the null and Alternate hypothesis I think the main the the main hypothesis we have is that this new reaction will increase the will increase user engagement or the primary success metric which I think we&#39;ve already mentioned our primary success metrics which are basically around reaction usage rate as well as number of stories created um and by how much they will increase like let&#39;s say that&#39;s x% for now I think we can discuss that more when we discuss the power analysis step um but and yeah while not hurting the guardrail metrics and hopefully creating a slight increase or at least a neutral change in in the Northstar metric okay yeah and would you would you mind writing down the hypotheses for us oh yeah sure yeah so I think that&#39;s sort of the main hypothesis and the alternate I mean the null hypothesis is just that it won&#39;t have it&#39;s sort of just the opposite of that that there won&#39;t won&#39;t be any effect on the uh on the primary success metric um and we&#39;ll also measure the secondary metrics to sort of like learn more about this new feature okay perfect um so now that you have your hypotheses how do you plan on actually testing them yeah so I think at this point you it depends so I think most big companies these days have experimentation platform forms so basically the selection of the statistical test I think is usually handled automatically by the experimentation platform which I think is would be the case here as well but I think typically since we can expect pretty large sample sizes for this experiment I think a z test is usually good enough to cover most of the metrics um we discussed I think one sort of thing Nuance I would like to mention here is because this is not user based randomization but rather cluster randomization so we will still have fewer samples than we would have if it was randomized at a user level and so that&#39;s why I think we would want to probably think of some additional variance reduction like clustering standard errors or other techniques I think there&#39;s there is some published research on this topic so I would probably spend some time on like looking into some of those techniques as well experimentation platform might already also account for some of these um sorry are you saying fewer samples overall or like samples overall okay yeah so why why would that be the case because I mean if you had assigned at the user level then each user is a separate observation right so for example if you have 50 million users you could theoretically have like even if you assign like 10% of the population for example you would still have like 5 million users which is a pretty big sample size but now because we&#39;re assigning clusters then like that will probably become a few magnitudes smaller because like each cluster probably will have at least I think on average most users will have at least like a few hundred people in their Network so okay so are you saying that our observations so we you&#39;re collecting one observation from each cluster rather than each user yeah okay okay and uh in that is that in the form of like aggregated metrics like averages or something like that yeah I think averages would be like the the main one to start with and then I mean obviously for some clusters you if some clusters seem like I guess you could also look at distributions or like look at it by cluster if if something seems odd or or if you want to sort of investigate if some deeper analysis questions but in general like the average treatment effect is what you would what you would start with okay I see yeah and um you mentioned you would use as Z test uh can you explain briefly why yeah so I think in general um like a z test is good for proportions proportional metrics or when you know um when you have like a large enough sample size a z test and a T Test are pretty similar so T Test is the other common test which is more used for continuous metrics um so in our case I think we were measuring a lot of rates which are proportions so a z test is relevant there some of our metrics which we discussed could be continuous metrics like the number of stories created for example for that T Test would be ideal but again as the sample size increases and I think I mean typically the standard that you you use as like a few thousands so as long as your sample size is more than a few thousands the Z test and T Test are actually pretty much identical so it doesn&#39;t matter as much which one you use okay so I think a z test would like cover most of our metrics okay yeah that makes sense to me um okay so yeah I think the next step is the power analysis so that will help determine how long we need to run this experiment for so do typically there are four main inputs for p analysis like do you want me to go into detail in all of them or I can just sort of like briefly mention uh if you could just give a high level summary of everything that&#39;d be helpful yeah the first main input is the effect size or mde I think this is the one of the most important inputs which also requires some input from other stakeholders such as product managers ET because this is basically the effect size that we expect that our primary success metric would be would change by so for example I think when we stated the the alternate hypothesis we said our primary success metric would improve by x% so the X here is basically the effect size the smallest X here is the effect size or MD and basically the effect size should be practically significant that is theoretically you could measure like a really small change like say a 0 1% change in your success metric but that&#39;s probably not going to be too meaningful for the business and it may not be worthwhile to run an experiment which only moves primary success metrics by such a small percentage so I think that&#39;s why here I would discuss with uh other stakeholders to decide what uh uh practical MD looks like and we could also use historical data in this this case like for example we probably have some data around what the effect size was when our initial reactions were launched so we could try to use that as a baseline as well um next input is power so this is just the probability of detecting a true effect if there is one and the industry standard is8 um so yeah I think unless we have a very specific reason for changing the power I think usually 08 is is a pretty standard measurement for this input then the next one is significance level or Alpha uh and this is basically the the probability of detecting false positives um and again the industry standards basically point is usually 05 which so basically if you increase Alpha um that means you&#39;re increasing the or I guess the way to understand Alpha is um you&#39;re okay with the possibility that five that 5% of the times um your test might say that there is an effect but there actually isn&#39;t so 5% of the times you might have false positives in your results um um is that is a denominator on that over all results or only over positive results it&#39;s the false positive so false positives is like the number of positives that are false out of all positives right yeah yeah yeah so again like usually 05 is the standard so I think unless we want to be like very if we want to be extra careful about not detecting any false positives then we would reduce Alpha okay um but otherwise we would just keep it at 0 5 mhm um and then variance is yeah so variance is just how much variation there is in the data and that&#39;s typically estimated using historical data for for the main metrics of Interest M um and yeah there are variance reduction techniques we can use because reducing variance basically increases the power of the test so typically we would in put all of these into a power into a sample size calculator um and then that would give us the sample size needed um given the MD power and other parameters um and then once we have the sample size we can then estimate the duration of the experiment needed to get the sample size and that would again be based on traffic like historical traffic data like how many users do we typically see how many active users do we typically see per day we can estimate based on that but there are some other factors to consider as well when determining the duration I think the main one is seasonality or variability in in the metric so for example users Behavior might be quite different on weekday versus weekend so right we want to probably run the test for at least one week to ensure that we capture this variability um and oh yeah one other important thing I think is the app adoption so if this is a client change for example then it might be it might be the case that users need to download or install the latest um version of the app in which case it it might take us some time for this new client version to get enough adoption so we probably want to account for that as well when we&#39;re deciding how long to run the test for okay awesome so this sounds like a really detailed power analysis let&#39;s say you&#39;ve done the power analysis and you&#39;re running the test now uh I&#39;m curious um how you would go about analyzing the test results yeah so I think assuming yeah assuming the everything looks fine um I think we would first of all just look at overall metrics so like the average treatment effect overall for all our metrics um and then I think you there could be some tradeoffs so then there we would probably discuss some trade-offs um but also another way to sort of gain a better understanding of why certain metrics move the way they did could be to look at uh more Gran granular user segments so for example some of the you I think one user segment we talked about was celebrities versus regular users but some other ones might be new versus tenured users um I think that could be interesting because for a new user like all the reactions are basically new to them whereas for 10y old users maybe they&#39;re already accustomed to using certain reactions so they may not even notice this new reaction so I think that could be an interesting segment to look at I think infrequent versus frequent users maybe is another one because like some segment of users who are very frequent users of the app or like so-called super users um they might be like a more influential segment like for example if that segment is using this reaction a lot more like we might still consider rolling out the new reaction even if in general we don&#39;t see that much usage in the in the infrequent users um so so yeah I think some of these segments can also help determine what the next steps would be and also in the trade-off discussion which for trade-off discussions I would typically again involve all the main stakeholders and sort of like talk through what the different options are because I think some like it&#39;s not always necessary that the next step of the experiment is to like either launch or not launch like you could for example do like follow-up tests on certain segments as I said or maybe you want to like tweak the feature like for example in this case if you notice that a lot of users are just ignoring the notification so they&#39;re not even aware that this new feature exists like maybe we could think about ways to improve awareness and launch a follow-up test there so yeah I think those would be like a few of the considerations I would uh think about okay amazing yeah so I&#39;m curious um we might have touched upon this a little bit but like near the when a new feature has beened sometimes the in the beginning of that feature being launched users will engage with it a little bit differently from how they might later on I&#39;m wondering how you might be able to handle this oh yeah so I think yeah novelty effect is definitely like a big consideration and especially in these types of new user features I think one way to do that could be to have like a hold gra hold back group of um users so basically you could have like a small percentage of users say may somewhere between 1 to 5% of the total population where even if you do decide to roll this roll this feature out more broadly this small holdback group of users still sees the control experience that is they don&#39;t actually see this new reaction um and then you can let this whole back group stay for a few months and then at the end of that longer time period you can see um whether like the weather usage for the new group is still um is still much higher than the than the old group like the overall reaction or what your key success metrics like if th those Trends still hold okay perfect that sounds like a good plan um yeah and I think um I think one other thing I would add is so far like all the things we&#39;ve discussed have been quantitative like purely looking at data but I think it&#39;s also a good idea to think about like user research studies or more qualitative sort of analysis especially if there are certain segments of users which are showing different behaviors or showing behaviors which we&#39;re like interested in exploring further uh can you give me one example of a type of qualitative analysis or user study that you might do yeah like I think one thing is like if we find that for for a small percentage of users like they really like this feature and they&#39;re using it repeatedly um whereas like most of the other users are not then I think we would might be interested in why for this small User Group this feature seems to be much more popular so I think there like we might maybe do some ux studies where we actually talk to a few users from that group um yeah I think that&#39;s one example okay amazing uh so you did a fantastic job I felt like this was such a detailed and well thoughted answer uh I think this is a great place for us to pause so I&#39;d love to hear from you if you were to analyze this interview as if you were the interviewer what do you think went well and what do you think you might change next time yeah I think overall I think following a structured framework I think helped me in sort of like making sure that I was uh thinking about each step of the experiment process and also hopefully it was I think it made the answer clearer yes and sort of like more structured I think in terms of improvements I mean I feel like there&#39;s especially with these types of experiments I think there&#39;s like always details around like the Implement and especially like the randomization as well as analyzing different user segments so I feel like that sort of discussion uh like we can have like a much deeper discussion I think if like given more time MH yeah totally um and I felt similarly about the structure I actually really lik the structure I felt like it was super well organized and it follows very closely to what you would actually do as a data scientist on the job so it was really helpful for both accuracy and Clarity of your answer um I also really like that you pursued many different types of metrics so not just ones that are like very directly related to the new feature that you&#39;re trying to implement but also ones that are um measuring like overall like uh product success you know because of course you don&#39;t want to like cause some unknown regression in a product in some unintended way um yeah uh as for things that might that I might consider changing so I think you sort of touched upon this that um this was an answer that had so many different like details to it sometimes it can help to just give like a quick explanation of like why or how you would Implement something so for example like why did you choose a zes or uh if you are planning on assigning users to different user clusters how and when does that assignment happen and also I think it wasn&#39;t super clear until the end that um the measurements that you&#39;re taking are going to be averaged over each user cluster rather than only making individual samples from each user um but yeah otherwise like I felt like this was such a complete and like wellth thought out answer so thank you so much for coming here today to uh give us some insights on this question yeah thanks for having yeah and thanks everybody for watching if you have an upcoming

to be here hey everyone I&#39;m Rakesh I&#39;m currently a PM at Microsoft I work on the Apple ecosystem mostly uh previously I&#39;ve been at companies such as Google as a TPM and SpaceX and a few

questions with full written Solutions over a million people use exponent to Ace their interviews in product management software engineering Engineering Management machine learning data science and much much more get started for free at trixon so let&#39;s get into it the question I love to ask you today is estimate the internet bandwidth needed for a thousand graduate students the question I have is like there are many types of graduate students right there are people within the medical field there people within computer science the people within liberal arts and many other fields and the question itself is going to be dependent on what type of students we choose so for the scap scope of this question at least would you say that it&#39;s fair to assume or choose Liberal Arts students as the category that we want to pursue can you tell me more behind that rationale yes um this is just anecdotal um most anecdotal kind of thing but I think when I was at undergrad University um and majority of the students at the University of Michigan were labor Arts Majors I think it encompassed at least 40 plus percent where you had all the other Majors combined into more smaller kind of Aggregates so the reason why I chose that was everywhere you go you see a level Arts major it&#39;s mostly because the courses are so vast and popular that many students love the program so just wanted to choose that as a good kind of majority point at least sure sure and I think you might be also alluding to the level of usage of one&#39;s computer you know when you&#39;re more inside of a classroom setting for the majority of your time and also doing a lot of computer related tasks such as writing Etc versus I think you mentioned earlier in the medical field you might be actually interacting with patients is that also a factor that is also a factor I think you need is spot on like for medical students you may have an issue where people or the students themselves may not use their mobile much actively but maybe rely on iPads for writing down notes or kind of scribbling down a few Concepts but where in computer science what I&#39;ve observed is that mostly students would rely on their laptop or desktop to code and kind of test out and problem solve and uh in other majers you may have neither you may just have more mobile usage it really depends on kind of student Persona there but I would say Le Arts is a good average of all these scenarios so I think that&#39;s a good starting point now with that being said I think the thing I would want to kind of categorize is kind of the platform so we have I think I kind of mentioned these but we have desktop we have mobile um we also have other kind of platforms like iPad but for the sake of this question at least I would like to consider desktop and mobile since the most commonly used and uh given the scenario that not many people have iPads not many of these students may have them so that&#39; be fair sure yeah I think it&#39;s okay to standardize amongst desktop and mobile and we don&#39;t have to consider F fancy things like iot devices or anything like that so desktop and mobile it is perfect with that being said um I think the next thing I would like to do and start off and breakdown is the day-to-day schedule of the average graduate student that&#39;ll help us kind of understand how many hours do they actually put into these uh put into online usage and how many hours they spend on offline usage that&#39;d be fine yes so let&#39;s assume as an average human being student or a non-student the person sleeps eight hours per day so that gives us around 16 hours of active a wait time let&#39;s say in these 16 hours that the person sleeps uh sorry the person spends some time eating breakfast getting ready having lunch having dinner so let&#39;s take an hour for each maybe three hours so how much do a Le both with 13 hours um for the sake of kind of recreation and hobbies let&#39;s kind of remove another 3 hours since people may want to go to the gym or kind of do other activities maybe have play some sport if not do some other activity which is individualistic to that person so I&#39;m going to remove another three hours from that that gives us a total of 10 hours for us to work with so I think the interesting scenario here is that uh classes and how much time do classes take per day um so I&#39;m going to assume for the sake of this exercise we&#39;re working we can do either the weekday or the weekend because they both have different structures but for the sake of this exercise I would propose we would do their normal school day would that be fine with you sure yeah we can always um talk about that at the end where potentially we can make different estimates and stuff like that perfect yep for the S of this question moving ahead with the school day let&#39;s assume maybe I know that some students take a higher course load per semester so they may have maybe 6 hours eight hours of classes I remember I had semesters where I would spend a majority of my time in classes but I also have semesters where my friends and I used to spend maybe not that much time maybe four hours in classes so why don&#39;t I take the middle ground here and say six hours of classwork per day which I&#39;m actively in class that&#39;d be fine as an assumption so if classes are about one hour long or maybe they&#39;re different different in your experience in graduate school you&#39;re assuming that around a graduate student is taking about six classes per day um I would not assume six classes per day because um the typical at least to my anecdotal experience classes were really long when you take a four semester for credit of course um they typically range between three-hour seminars where you have series of like mini group discussions all these other activities but they usually take three hours I think one hour is too small for for uh credit course but um let&#39;s assume each one is about three hours so that&#39;s like two courses per day different kinds rotating depending on the DAT would would that be fair sure sure okay that gives us six hours of class time and four hours of let&#39;s assum study time because we already to have taken out Hobbies we all we already taken out kind of day-to-day uh usage like U eating socialization Etc so let&#39;s say four hours of active study time to prepare and get ready for these classes would you say that&#39;s fair that&#39;s fair okay okay now comes the interesting part how do we categorize these in terms of desktop versus mobile so the thing with classes is that most professors at least most likely to my anecdotal experience would not want people actively using their mobile devices in class unless they have a really good reason to um and we have an UCare scenario where people kind of still use their mobile phone kind of actively and just put it on the side or do whatever they want but they&#39;re not actively kind of fully engaged on it so I&#39;m going to remove that ucation scenario and consider that people have their laptops open at least for a majority of these six hour sessions because they&#39;re taking notes they&#39;re referencing something most people have their laptops open but may not actively use it so would you say a good active usage here would be 4 hours Within These six hours of classes and two hours of just non-active passive usage where the active laptop is in standby would you say this a good assumption yeah I think that&#39;s reasonable and feel free by the way to just assume things and I will jump in if I have questions around where that rationale is coming from perfect now with that freedom I&#39;m going to assume that four hours of Active Desktop usage out of those six hours and two hours of standby and the remaining four hours I would um want to assume since it&#39;s preparing and studying uh I would say it&#39;s a mix of both mobile and desktop usage so I would say two more hours of mobile usage per day and I would say two hours of laptop usage so that gives us a total of six hours per day of active laptop or desktop usage and two hours of mobile usage I would be curious about the mobile usage right anecdotally speaking just looking at screen scen time numbers they&#39;re far above 2 hours probably for most folks how do you square that and how would you consider that or yeah would you push back I&#39;m I&#39;m curious where that two hours um is how you&#39;re justify into two hours here that&#39;s a good question I would say on the lower Spectrum uh a typical student could have a soon eror where they&#39;re not actively checking their phone and sitting on their phone they could just use it and between bus rides use it between kind of coffee breaks for a few minutes and that all adds up to two hours of a time sometimes they have a quick thing they want to check on their phones or kind of a video they want to watch for a quick relaxing break so I like I I see what your question is coming from and I do agree on the point so why don&#39;t I do this why don&#39;t I keep the two hours as active meaning that people use it on an active basis but remember the three hours I kind of subtracted at the beginning which was mostly hobbies and Recreation I did also want to consider since you mentioned it that sometimes people rely on their mobile devices and depend on many social network platforms as recreational activities but not everyone so why don&#39;t I kind of push that a bit more since we&#39;re definitely seeing more screen time to saying let&#39;s add another two hours of those three hours so that brings up the total Mobile hours per day to four and I think that&#39;s a good total screen time per day not considering the too too many extreme cases for the typical grad student do you say this Fair okay great I think that sounds much more fair awesome so now that gives us a total of 10 hours per day on active internet usage for both devices combined um with that being said I think the next step is for us to break down the activities associated with each device and we can clumb them together but I want to kind of lay out my kind of perspectives some of these activities would you agree perfect so out of the six desktop hours what I&#39;ve kind of came up with and assumed is let&#39;s say the student uses three hours of the desktop or the laptop time to kind of watch videos regarding the lecture while inside kind of class or maybe not in class maybe spend some time just watching informational videos which related to class that is and I would say the remaining three hours we would be spent on taking notes kind of writing up a few papers drafting up a few ideas and other miscellaneous activities checking your email Etc would you say those are fair assumptions okay and for the mobile side I think this is where it gets interesting I would say two hours of miscellaneous activities this could be something like texting um maybe responding to a few friends Etc and two hours of active social media feed which is pretty maybe content heavy this could be any anywhere from watching a YouTube on a video on YouTube which is played in high quality or something even as watching a few Instagram reals or Tik Tok reals I&#39;m not sure if Tik Tok is still available but um something of that kind would you say that&#39;s fair that&#39;s fair now I think the next step is to kind of make an assumption on how many what&#39;s the bandwidth of these individual activties and kind of use that as a data point for us to get started I would say for the desktop scenario just 3 hours of browsing and maybe surfing the web could take anywhere from one mbbs per kind of per kind of I would say the interval of time and this time let&#39;s say is kind of one minute so per minute I would say one Mbps for kind of miscellaneous activities like drafting up a paper Google doc slides or whatever kind of or operational tools you&#39;re using maybe another one Mbps for the sake of Simplicity and for I would say the mobile scenario I&#39;ve estimated the high quality videos maybe something like a high quality video on YouTube or other social media platforms could be five Mbps per minute and the other thing about um social media which is kind of um like you see high quality re sometimes you don&#39;t you scroll down and watch a few high quality pictures I want to take maybe not five but somewhere around three Mbps would you say that those are fair assumptions okay now with that being said let&#39;s do a few some math so I&#39;m going to walk you through it so I would say for the first person of the desktop which is 3 hours so that&#39;s 3 hours * 1 Mbps that&#39;s equal to 3gb for browsing as well we have another 3gb for mobile considering random social media videos pictures reals we have three hours of that sorry we have two hours of that so that&#39;s two times 2 hours time 3 mbbs that&#39;s equal to 6 GB per day and we we have high quality video so that&#39;s 2 hours of high quality video Time 5 MPS that&#39;s equal to 10 gabt per day so how much does that give us if we sum all these together so we have three plus three that is six total for desktop and we have 6 + 10 which is 16 total for mobile that&#39;s roughly equal to 22 GB per day per student on average in this scenario and I think the first and primary top most question was how about okay you got it for one student but what is it for a thousand students so that&#39;s 22 gigabytes times 1,00 per day which is equal to roughly 22 terabytes per day I think this metric gives us a good average considering the assumptions we made and the methodology we used but I do want to raise um some concerns and if you risks here but before I do so do you have any follow-up questions to that did the math make sense um open for your feedback yeah I think the math made a lot of sense and great that you recalled the a thousand student prompt I am curious where you think and maybe this leads to the next portion you&#39;re about to cover but where do you think that some of these um where do you think that some of this estimation could have gone wrong or could have been improved I think that&#39;s a good question I think this goes back to the sanity check so I think the first and most important thing are the assumptions that we take in mind uh I think the the scope of considering level Arts students as the average kind of graduate level student is kind of maybe not the best way of estimating this question I would say if I had more time and if I were an actual PM investigating this issue I would take a random a average of students so I would take 100 medical students I would take 100 L art students I would take a 100 maybe chemistry or psychology students and so on so I get a good distribution of these random people and I would actually dive deep into some of these personas and maybe have surveys to understand their typical behavior and maybe average all that together to and remove kind of the standard deviation so we have a better understanding of these different students in real sense that gives us a more accurate representation of a good student base so that&#39;s something which I would definitely improve if I had more time and the second thing which really concerns me here in this estimation is the Assumption of how people use their time I&#39;ve seen students I know in this example we took six hours of desktop and four hours of mobile I&#39;ve seen scenarios where people may not really depend on desktop maybe not spend more than two three hours per day but I&#39;ve seen scenarios where people would spend a lot of time on mobile and the same other way around I was seen people maybe a group of students in a particular field refrain from using mobile too much and spend a majority of their time on desktop take computer science students for example a lot of their time spent on coding and problem solving preparing for interviews um testing out their code Etc so you don&#39;t see many of these people kind of interact with their mobile device too much as much as compared to their desktop so just that one example can give you a lot of info on the type of variations of how people use their mobile voice desktop so I would say once again if I had more time I would kind of have a better representation and uh kind of use that to classify how to measure these uh thousand graduate students and the final thing if those two made sense I will stop there before you have any questions before I talk about the third thing I would improve no please go ahead go ahead yep the third thing I would improve is the actual measure of data so I think at the beginning of the conversation I mentioned how we were assuming this is in the United States I do understand that depending on the location of the University the graduate program students have different behaviors they have different sleep schedules they have different Customs to what they&#39;re accommodating to um and even the minor factors like weather could affect a lot about how students spend their day and even how much sunlight is coming in in to the day how much how much like nighttime is during the day there&#39;s so many um dependent variables here to consider so I would consider all these into cons consideration when making these uh large claims and would actually get a accurate data point on on how much bandwidth on average is taken per activity in much more critical detail I know we made assumptions about one mbbs on for active surfing I think it may be more um I made that basic assumption but I would get those numbers really accurate so we can have a really good concrete mathematical uh and U datadriven uh way to estimate this so I would definitely improve on these three to four points had more time thanks for Kesh so why don&#39;t we move on to Let&#39;s consider the mock closed let&#39;s move on to the feedback portion do you have any quick feedback besides the stuff that you mentioned earlier for yourself and then I&#39;ll dive into the um what an interview interviewer rubric feedback might look like for you I think I would have spent some more time on asking a few more clarifying questions I think I have done a decent job but would have focused a bit more on kind of getting those really been clear and maybe I would have spent a bit more time on kind of laying out my methodology of selecting and choosing a few assumption based numbers on how people spend their day I know that for the sake of this exercise and for the sake of kind of the Simplicity of it me wanting to get a more of a average figure in the way uh I chose a few assum numbers so definitely spend more time thinking about my thought process and doing so um I think I would also consider a few more edge cases so I know that the numbers here are really simple and straightforward but what I would do is consider edge cases whereas what about if students or these graduate level students are in a time of study or in a maybe end of semester exams or maybe something like summer break that greatly affects um a lot of these estimations and I would consider different cases for all these and maybe combine them at the end but that complicates a lot of things so I think that complication is sometimes necessary to get a more crisp answer but would have done that um but yeah I think those are the things I think I would reflect about myself if we on top of my head but what do you think perfect yeah so I actually did thought you did a really great job especially on the clarification this question is deceptively simple and so I think you hit on some of the major points which I&#39;ll get to in a second things that I thought you did well Rakesh so first of all great job scoping down the U problem and making it a lot more manageable right and you did that in the clarification section you talked about Liberal Arts students I might have just kept it a little bit more General right like something about um students who spend a lot of time on their laptops or in the office as opposed to out of the office I.E lawyers doctors etc etc so that might have been a little bit too Niche but overall still fine um the devices that one uses and the scheduling was all super clear as well so I appreciated that number two I thought thought you did a really great job rolling with the punches for when the you when the interviewer pushes back and when you get to more advanced level interviews that is going to happen much more frequently and I thought you did so with a really positive attitude and was able to come back with a coherent answer and then number three I thought you did a great job in this section where you called out where the estimation could have gone wrong and that&#39;s definitely a more advanced um estimation tactic right where you are proactively telling the interviewer hey you know this isn&#39;t perfect if I had XYZ data this is what I would be looking into obviously no one&#39;s going to know a lot of this off the top of their head and I want to call out that most people are not going to know bandwidth and megabits per second and what is a sort of reasonable MVPs so that could have been something um someone clarifies at the beginning of an interview as well no one is expecting you to memorize these numbers okay so that those are on the positives on the things that you could have improved so this is a more minor presentation point where cash and this is something a lot of people struggle with but you have a bit of upspeak which means that your tone goes up at the end of your sentences so for example you would say mobile usage desktop usage in general when you lift the tone at the end of the sentence it sounds like a question and it&#39;s not as confident sounding so I&#39;d practice down speake more again a lot of people face that issue I do that sometimes too so don&#39;t feel don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s um something that you know is something you can&#39;t overcome right everyone does this Mak number two is try to be more proactive with things in general en right so whether it&#39;s giving I think I was the one who prompted you to say hey where could these things go wrong or I think in general it&#39;s like hey like I&#39;ll jump in if I have any um concerns and then you still consistently ask does that sound good with you which is a good technique to check in with the interviewer but maybe you can do so by saying hey I&#39;m going to move on to the next section if that&#39;s all right with you or just tell me what you&#39;re going to do next instead of just stopping and saying hey does that sound good with you right so it&#39;s already great that you&#39;re checking in that&#39;s definitely necessary but do so in a more proactive manner either by calling out some risks and considerations and or just moving the interview along the reason that&#39;s important is as a PM you want to be seen as a leader you want to be seen as someone who can rally the crowd and rally the conversation so that would help with um an interviewer being more confident in your skill sets for this role and then the final thing I would say is this question can be very um convoluted and the interviewer can lose the structure very quickly and so I would recommend some sort of visual asset to go along with this type of question of course we&#39;re doing this virtually in person there&#39;s whiteboards there&#39;s paper stuff like that but to the extent that you can either screen share and or you know lift up your piece of paper that you&#39;re working on and show me the mathematical equation you&#39;re drawing out that would help me follow along a little bit better because I will admit once it was the middle section and we&#39;re making all these assumptions etc etc it&#39;s very easy to get lost I agree but that said overall Rish I thought you did a fantastic job and I really appreciate you coming in to chat with us today any last thoughts you want to share well I would like to thank you Kevin for kind of helping me with this exercise I felt great it was refreshing and I had a great time with it why quite likewise [Music]""}, {""title"": ""System Design Interview - Design

Management machine learning data science and much much more get started for free at trixon lovely happy to have you here okay let&#39;s jump into our question so rvy today I&#39;d like you to design a distributed lru cache okay so lru like the least uh least recently used kind of thing um fair enough okay so let me actually kind of get some details around this so that uh I have I have the uh you know uh details what like the requirements what we are going to design essentially um so as I understand uh Nema about cash like it is primarily used for you know data storage and reading the data and it uh it it is used for like some frequently accessed data and Mak the reads and wrs faster essentially and um distributed cache is a caching system where like multiple servers will store the information like it will be distributed across multiple servers and uh we can we can will still have that frequently Access Data fast access to that data that&#39;s primarily what I&#39;m thinking now question I have here is that um uh I mean the main use case is user should be able to insert their data and retrieve the data that&#39;s a primary use case any other requirement that you have apart from this no I think that that about sums it up we want it to be distributed that&#39;s the main that&#39;s the main thing all right so I&#39;ll use this one here so for the functional requirements um primarily I think what we can have I&#39;ll use this yeah users can insert o just a moment I&#39;ll just do a few all right okay so user should be able to insert the data insert data and user should be users can fetch or retrieve data I would say so that&#39;s primarily I would say the main functionalities that we are looking at for the cash all right uh so uh you said a distributed cash by the way uh so distributed lru cach now uh when you say distributed obviously there are some non-functional requirements that are coming into my mind uh and primarily actually I would say something like U um availability is for sure uh is coming into my mind being highly available because at any point of time uh users should be able to uh you know get their data into the cache and obviously retrieve that data so high availability for sure seems like once um similarly like highly scalable because there might be the number of requests might increase and we we should be able to accommodate and not degrade the performance of our of our cash service yep um apart from that I mean obviously the performance I mean uh it has to be performant like uh uh we should be able to retrieve the data as fast as possible and obviously insert the data also as fast as possible um yeah overall I think these are the things uh any other consideration that you want me to have here let&#39;s talk a little bit about consistency what are your thoughts on that uh well I mean going by the principles of system design design obviously we cannot have a you know High tight consistency uh with high availability also uh so it kinds of It kind of it&#39;s a tricky situation to have I would say um I mean I would love to discuss it as we evolve into the design uh for sure I&#39;ll keep a marker here uh something like I would say uh look look for tight consistency and discuss accordingly I would put a marker here yep there will have to be some trade-offs is what I&#39;m foreing here and uh would love to discuss when we reach up to that point that point okay all right so these are the requirements here that we have and let&#39;s get uh started with this um so I can clearly see uh that uh you know uh first I would like to address these uh the functional requirements and uh then would like to move it into the distributed uh or the non-functional things actually so let&#39;s first start with a single machine implementation where I can have uh I would like to talk about the API design actually so if I just discuss on the API design for this okay um we need for the functional requirement we need to insert the data so one of the first methods that I&#39;m thinking is an insert method here MH and u the parameters that I&#39;m thinking about the insert method is um first of all I mean let&#39;s say if I talk about fast retrieval if I have to implement the cache on a single machine let&#39;s say and for a fast retrieval um I should be I should be talking about the implementation of this cache and as far as the implementation goes I think um hashmap is something that comes to my mind where we usually store it in the form of a key value pair in the cache like the value will be stored against a key and essentially in a hashmap kind of a data structure we should be able to retrieve it in of one time so insert should have a key and the corresponding value is what I&#39;m thinking here and uh key obviously will be unique similarly for the retrieval I think there will be something like a retrieve method is what I&#39;m thinking and for the retrieval I think we should uh by the way like insert would return something as simple as 200 if it&#39;s successfully inserted or if if there is any kind of an issue accordingly it will either return a 4xx or a 5xx kind of an error yeah if it&#39;s a client side or a server side can up an error so that&#39;s the response that insert would give a retrieve we only need the key accordingly it should be able to return us the relevant value MH or again if there are some errors accordingly relevant error codes like if it&#39;s it&#39;s a successful retrieve 200 otherwise 4 EXs or five kind of an error yeah now that&#39;s primarily I&#39;m thinking about from an API design perspective um and uh one more thing which I&#39;m thinking here is um about the single service or single machine implementation so just talking about the implementation briefly uh I mean the insert would work something like like I would say uh I would go and check in the in the cache that if that key already exists or not so something like if key exists and if it uh does not exist by the way if it does not exist um we can go ahead and you know we can go ahead and insert it if it does not exist however now when I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s not like we have unlimited space here right caches will have a limited space so even if the key does not exist we also need to make a check that if the cache is full or not if we have memory to insert a new information or not yeah um and that is where that is where I mean this consideration comes from the place that that is where this lru nature of the cach would primarily you know uh stand out so how do we evict the item how do we evict the item this is where the lru algorithm will come into picture that whichever item is least recently used is not that much popular with the users we will kick that out to make space for the new item yeah and a hashmap a simple hashmap would not be able to track it I mean we have essentially just a key and a value so a simple hashmap would not be able to track the order in which the items exist and what I would essentially go with is to have another another data structure like along with the hashmap and that would be something like a q I would say a Q and not exactly a queue but I mean kind of an implementation of a queue in in essentially I think I&#39;ll go for a link list actually because we should be able to Traverse across the items present at the same key uh I would say uh sorry not the same key but essentially we should be able to arrange the item rearrange the items the order of the items actually so that is where I think the link list makes sense and more so I mean for better I would say better retrieval speeds and all since performance is a major consideration here I would actually suggest using a w link list so that from any place we can iterate or move either in the forward or the backward Direction MH now what would happen that okay we see see cach is full we go through the W link list we go to the tail of the W link list essentially because that would be the least recently used like least uh popular item we would kick that out we would remove that we get a space now we insert our new item and when I when we insert we place that at the head because that is the fresh you know completely fresh item so we insert that item as the head of the list uh and similarly like um uh if the cash is not full the similar thing follow except that we do not need to kick out anything else because we still have space we can insert the new item at the head it&#39;s as simple as that um if the key already exists obviously we don&#39;t need to insert the item in the cache uh we already have the key um now for the retrieval for the retrieval I would go with uh so this is for uh insert this is for insert and for the retrieval we can go with something like okay um okay if the key exists all right we will again go through the same question if key exists we can actually go ahead and fetch the key and when we fetch the key so like this is a yes situation when we fetch the key uh that key becomes used like that has been recently used so essentially wherever that lies in this W link list we need to move that particular item to the head of the link list because now that&#39;s the order that we are maintaining accordingly the other items will shift one place further to make space for the head like that rearrangement will happen and U similarly like if the key does not exist then essentially it&#39;s a cache Miss and we have to go and I would say retrieve the uh item from the actual data store where uh you know where we are serving the cash from so over this is how the implementation would work so the get would see that okay if uh you know if uh we have the item uh we will access the item and move it to the head of the list and if it if the item is not there no then it&#39;s a cach Miss we will go to the actual data store and Fest item from there it&#39;s as simple as that insert well two two places I would say two phase if the key already exist all right so then U we would uh we would uh we would not have to insert anything by the way I just realized that if the key exist yes situation in the yes situation also uh we don&#39;t need to insert anything new but we have tried to access that key and that key again would be moved to the head of the head of the uh W link list because that yeah increases its recentness actually yeah and if it&#39;s not there then we will check cash for full kind of condition and accordingly we will either uh you know delete item from the tail to make space for the thing and all those kind of stuff and if the cache we have the space we would anyways insert it in either case the new item will be at the head of the link list is there a particular reason we need link list here and not a simple link list uh we that&#39;s a good question yeah uh now I&#39;m thinking out loud that if we go with a single simple link list here uh this rearrangement I would say this rearrangement would be like we can we have to always start from the head I would say we have to always start from the head in order to go for the rearrangement if we have to like shift items by one place is what I&#39;m trying to suggest now if we have a doubly link list it&#39;s not like we are bound to start only from the head we should be able to start from any position actually so for example what I&#39;m trying to say is um um okay so let&#39;s say if I have some item which is somewhere in the middle here all right and I try to access it by the algorithm first of all it should be moved to the Head M and we should be able to move uh the remaining items accordingly shift their place um I cannot think of any particular reason that a double link is stands out there it is just that I when I think about the more granular implementation is where I&#39;m thinking that you know there might be some algorithmic optimization something like probably not sure I mean binary search will not be used because this is not sorted at all but uh I&#39;m just thinking from a granular level implementation maybe maybe that that is where the D L list might be helpful uh but again I might come up with a better reason later on yeah yeah are you losing anything by using a doubly link list versus a simple link list uh that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking right now I don&#39;t think uh is offering any significant Advantage as such but um I just uh was thinking out uh uh maybe from a futuristic aspect that uh from an access point of view w link list gives us the freedom to move in any direction with a single link list we only can move in a in a in a single I would say you know forward Direction with a double link list we can move even in the backward Direction actually even though right now we don&#39;t really have a use case for that but you&#39;re saying that for the future in case there is a situation absolutely absolutely and I don&#39;t see that I mean if we use a dou link list essentially I&#39;m not seeing any significant disadvantage that it is actually having I mean there is just an extra pointer that we are adding to each node so there is nothing much of a space thing that we are losing here so got it that&#39;s why I went for a w link list that there&#39;s no significant disadvantage here um so now with this um API design and U I would say this implementation now I&#39;m thinking of uh you know moving to um uh I would say and by the way one more thing with respect to the implementation which I&#39;m thinking is um we can have uh some setup uh I&#39;m thinking of a dedicated uh cash cluster so let me draw this line here so when I say dedicated cach cluster I mean to say that uh essentially there will be microservices or there will be different Services which will be making a calls to the data store and that is somewhere in the middle the cach would come into picture so what I mean to say that there will be this services and then there will be this cache and then there will be your data store so these Services actually try to access the data from the data store and caches optimize that retrieval is what I&#39;m trying to suggest now uh we can have these dedicated cache cluster that is dedicated separate machines where we can host our caches or Implement our caches so I&#39;m trying to suggest is dedicated uh cash cluster is what I&#39;m trying to suggest here where the services would be implemented in a different machine the caches would be in a different machine and um now when I&#39;m thinking from a distributed systems perspective um I&#39;m thinking that we can in a distributed system essentially we are going for a distributed cash because a single cache machine would not be able to store that much data that&#39;s why we want to distribute the data across different machines and U the distribution mechanism I&#39;m thinking about a simple range based kind of a uh sharding uh where maybe certain Keys let&#39;s say giving an example like let&#39;s say a to M the keys which have which start from a uh and accordingly a to M entries can be present in this one server one single machine accordingly and to further let&#39;s say Z let&#39;s say for example can be present in this one and each service poost or I would say each service would have the information about this partitioning I would say about this division that uh you know which servers have which range of data accordingly they have will have this information locally and based on what queries that they get based on the query that they get they will be able to decide which cach server or cas cluster do they need to make a call if let&#39;s say this service gets a request for something which is starting from T so it knows that hey the T1 is stored in this cash cluster actually not in this one it will be able to make that decision okay so that&#39;s the distributed implementation that I&#39;m thinking about uh just making a quick check do you have any any questions here what are some other strategies you would consider and why pick this one so U I went with a separate cache cluster here um the other option which I can think of is uh possibly you know uh possibly have um have the caching implemented or as as a simple process in in these servers or a service hosts itself I would say so we have these uh service hosts and um what I&#39;m suggesting is uh these caches are collocated in these service hosts itself the division the rest of the implementation is still the same like they are still sharded based on this range and all but now uh I mean what this implementation does now when I compare them um we are saving on the hardware cost here that&#39;s one advantage if you go with a collocated kind of an option so we are saving on the hardware cost it it is less operational overhead compared to this because now we don&#39;t need to maintain a separate cluster as such uh however however I can see the advantage of this you know dedicated cach cluster so this is the co-located option where the the advantages are that we are not having to have have extra Hardware no operational cost as such and it kind of helps with the scaling like scaling wise if we scale the service s accordingly the cash also will scale so we don&#39;t need to put out a separate activity for the cash scaling these are the advantages but then when I think about the dedicated one I think it offers a better isolation uh isolation of resources between the service and the caching like both have their own purpose and when I think from you know when I think from uh the system design principles of single responsibility principle and separation of concern and all those things I think this stands out to me because while scaling is an advantage here uh the high availability requirement that we have if the service host goes down well we lose the cachier also by the way so compromising on one service like if there&#39;s a problem with a service host well we don&#39;t have access to the cach also so these are the trade-offs these are the problems that exist here and considering the requirements that we have like high availability scalability and all those things I think I&#39;ll go with a dedicated cash cluster where it provides for for a better isolation of resources is uh like we have a single I would say single um single view or unified view of the caches for different services and uh we have the flexibility like since we have the division so we can it&#39;s not like whatever service or type of machine that we choose for the service host we have to go with that only for the caching now with this division we can choose you know multiple types of Hardwares we have the flexibility so that&#39;s why we go with a dedicated cash cluster here sounds good all right all right okay fair enough um I think uh so far so good we have been able to um I would say Implement a design um so essentially for the high level design I would say that uh we have a client we have a client and then uh we will have obviously some kind of a load balancer here or an API Gateway and which does the load balancing activity I&#39;m not going to details of that but it does a lot of things like auth indication maybe and your load balancing rate limiting and all those kind of stuffs okay then uh we have all our service hosts here I would say the service hosts and the service hosts as I told earlier they have the configuration of of the cach cluster like which cash cluster holds which range they have that configuration locally and then we have um the actual cache servers or cach cluster as you should say and each of the service host has has access to each of these cache clusters because of the configuration so that&#39;s the setup and finally we have the data store okay so that&#39;s how the I would say that&#39;s how the setup looks like the high level design I think we are good so far and if you don&#39;t have further questions I would get into the details the non-functional requirements and we can address the distributed requirements yeah all right awesome now uh one of the first thing that I&#39;m thinking here is how will um you know how will these um uh you know this cache uh the service would uh would make a call to this cache service actually and for that one essential thing which I think should be good to have is um I would have a process I would say uh you know a simple kind of Library so let&#39;s say this is the service Host this is the service host I would have a process or a service called the client the cash client now this client is different from this client by the way so this is the cash client actually all right now this is a simple I would say simple Library which uh resides in this application server and it holds all the information regarding the caches server uh and the cash client will choose um it will choose that uh you know uh which of the one of the cash servers so we decided that we had this ranging and all so the owners of choosing which you know cash cluster we have to go to uh that will be decided with the cash client because it will have all that information and um all the cash clients will have the consistent view of all the cache servers what that means is U you know we have different cach servers is what I meant and let&#39;s say again we have this ranging and all n2p let&#39;s say and few some other range now there might be different server or service hosts and again each will have their own cache client I&#39;ll call that CC for now each one of them will have the same view like when I say same view or constant view this cash client will be aware of these three Cash servers and the ranges that they are serving similarly this cash client will be aware of these three Cash servers and the ranges that they are serving so that&#39;s how uh the cash client would assist or would work uh however uh now stepping into the distributed nature uh I&#39;m seeing a problem here which I can identify is that uh let&#39;s say if one of the cach servers go uh if one of the cach servers goes down um how will these clients be updated or let&#39;s say if a new cache server is added actually if a new cach server is added and U uh you know maybe uh yeah all the information how will this cash client be updated about this so one of the one of the simplest way to do this is have a configuration file locally on these cach clients uh it will be a simple configuration file which would have this configuration maybe in a key value format again that range let&#39;s say a to M uh cache server one let&#39;s say something like this range n2p cash server to a very simple configuration file uh this would work but then again the problem here is that this is manual this is very manual and uh would require constant manual intervention for the change and updates and all those kind of stuffs uh the other thing and by the way uh and and this uh you know this manual stuff includes updating it on all the cache clients which is again increasing our complexity the simple U I would say U solution to this is maybe have a single unified configuration file uh I would say uh something like a central configuration where all the cach client can actually read from that configuration file that would I would say help us with that uh with that multile manual effort but again still it&#39;s a manual effort because we still need to keep in this configuration file updated manually so uh in consideration of all of this I think one uh one proposal that I have is to have a separate service separate configuration Management Service I would say something like a zookeeper kind of a thing now zookeeper is a very uh very famous I would say or very wellknown U I would say configuration service which uh maintains the information or keeps uh is used to maintain this uh server related information in a distributed nature where it will constantly be maintain maintaining a heartbeat connection with these different cach servers and let&#39;s say if it does not finds the heal check to succeed for some cash server uh the cash server would be taken out of out of the cluster and accordingly zookeeper would update the configuration and whenever the service or the cash client have to access the cache server they would refer or re read from the zoook I would say that hey what is the latest configuration give me the latest configuration according to the information exchange they can now go ahead and retrieve their data as usual so that&#39;s one way to solve this and this is completely automated is how I see with this zookeeper thing uh like having a separate configuration service MH we are actually automating things or I would say taking hands off the wheels where we don&#39;t need to be worried about constantly updating this configuration The Zookeeper will take care of that by by checking the heartbeat and the health of the cache servers and if there is a problem and all it will update the configuration and the services can read that updated configuration accordingly access the data all right okay now um this is something with respect to I would say uh the configuration management and all now thinking a bit more from uh some more aspects of non-functional requirements so just going back to the requirements that we collected so we have high availability performance I think we have discussed I think um uh the implementation hashmap and that link list implementation would essentially help us uh help us with the performance um and um this configuration service would present a consistent View Services can read from that configuration service and HIIT the cache servers so I think performance- wise we are pretty much covered let&#39;s talk about the high availability high scalability and uh we will also have a look at the consistency part here so when I look at high availability let me go here let&#39;s look at high availability availability yeah all right now U I would say that um the problem with availability here is right now we only discussed about let&#39;s say what if we have only a single cache server I mean what if that cache server goes down we essentially don&#39;t have the data and the best way to I mean the very straightforward way is to I would use a different uh color probably just to show it better so we have the cache server and we can have read replicas actually so this will be the primary let&#39;s say primary caching and this would be the read replicas I would say now read replicas would definitely help us with um um our improving our availability um and um what happens is that um we can uh we can have these primary and uh backup nodes and uh uh this would include I would say this would constitute one cache cluster this would be a single okay cache cluster and it works in a pretty straightforward fashion that if the primary goes down essentially uh there would be one of the read replicas which will be promoted to the primary which will be promoted to the primary if the primary goes down and again who promotes well this is where uh this is where the Zookeeper service let&#39;s say this goes down this is again where services like zookeeper shine because they can carry out this uh leader election and then there are different algorithms uh like raft is a very popular leader election algorithm a consensus algorithm by the way not a leader election but rafter is a very popular consensus algorithm and zookeeper can trigger uh who should be the new leader accordingly the one of the RC will be promoted and operations will continue as usual so another thing is that these R read replicas ideally I would have them in different data centers so for example this would be let&#39;s say in data center az1 this would be in a data different data center A2 U and this would further increase my availability um as you know I&#39;m not affected by only one particular region let&#39;s say something happens in this region then if I have all my replicas in that region everything will be affected so I&#39;m further improving my ability availability by going like this there are some some considerations here though yeah there are some consideration that uh you know we may choose to maintain strong consistency and this is where consistency comes into question that you know what if we want to maintain the information between these replicas consistently the replica and the master in that case well our performance will take a bit of it and what I mean to say is that we may choose to implement like hey um fine the rights will be going to the primary but the reads will be going to the uh to let&#39;s say the read replicas we can say like that but when the Right comes to the primary we will say that unless and until they are replicated across the replicas we will not give a confirmation to the client something like that I mean if we go with that kind of an implementation our performance would take a backseat slightly slight back seit I would say wait can we take a step why why would writing to the primary but reading from the replicas help with consistency uh yeah okay so it does not helps with the consistency I just uh propose that this can be a setup uh consistency is a different discussion here so what I&#39;m trying to uh suggest about consistency is first of all uh let me take this read and write out of the equation for now what I&#39;m suggesting about consistency is let&#39;s say if a Right comes to the primary and if you want to maintain a consist consent view so what I mean by consistent view is that&#39;s is let&#39;s say uh you know the primary has the updated data has an updated data like a latest key all right but it is still not present at the read replicas now if some read comes to the read replicas they don&#39;t have this updated key updated data so that&#39;s not a consistent view actually right yeah yes now that&#39;s that&#39;s what like if we want to provide uh best performance like best latency and all then we have to take set step back like we have to take a step back on the consistency part that we do not promote or promise tight consistency that&#39;s something we will have to go with otherwise if we go with tight consistency then our performance has to take a back seat is what I&#39;m trying to suggest got it okay I understand yeah so these are some trade-offs obviously uh and this totally depends on the business use case what we are dealing with and what the business wants to uh promise their clients so accordingly we can uh Implement them so that&#39;s one thing uh and similarly about scalability uh I mean U we with this with this clustering concept and with these replicas and all essentially uh and also with this zookeeper kind of a kind of a configuration service essentially all the setup in fact let me take this uh space here to draw the final design diagram so we&#39;ll have this client and then we will have this U uh API Gateway and load balancer thing which we discussed earlier and then finally we have this all these Services server hosts and then we have all this uh I would say cache clusters cash clusters or cash shards you can call them cash shards I would call them cash shards actually cash Shard clusters now this would have this U um setup like this why did I choose the same color I should have chosen different color yep so this would have this primary and these replicas in each cluster and uh essentially this will be repeated this will be something which will be repeated so that&#39;s the final setup I would say okay and uh overall I mean we&#39;ll have this configuration service in the middle here somewhere let&#39;s say something like a zookeeper configuration now with this setup what do we have is uh we have a very highly available setup for our cach and we have a highly scalable because now we can add or remove servers or I would say add or remove new clusters uh and just need to update them in the configuration service which would present all these services with a unified view of the of the caching setup so we have a highly available highly scalable setup here and performance- wise well the core implementation as I suggested is in the form of a hashmap and a link list I suggested a douin link list but yes we can go with a single link list also uh but uh uh yep obviously from U futuristic consideration I think uh maybe from some access Improvement perspective dou link list might have some Advantage but yeah again we can we can look into that uh probably in a more granular use case but that would be okay the primary I would say setup here uh so this is the configuration surveys we might need some monitoring also yep sorry uh just finishing it up some monitoring also that we might want to have so that we can have a full complete cache service so we might constantly want to Monitor and maybe share this monitoring information with the Zookeeper service configuration Management Service so yeah I think that will be the final design that I will go with uh and I will take any question that you might have yeah what are some what are some of the biggest limitations of this design so the biggest limitations I think U I&#39;ll go with uh I&#39;ll go with the discussion that uh we can we cannot have uh first starting off with the high availability versus consistent consistency debate we cannot have both of them uh if we are going for high availability uh we we have to we have to compromise on the consistency in the sense that I discussed that uh you know uh the rights would be going only to the master but we can read from any of the replicas so that way we are improving the availability but but compromising on the consistency so there is a limitation whichever option we go with if we go with tight consistency well we are compromising the performance as we discussed already earlier um other thing which I&#39;m thinking here is um we have some operational overhead obviously as I discussed earlier that operational overhead of maintaining this configuration service keeping it updated um and then uh uh we are maintaining like different read replicas in different data centers so there is a lot of Maintenance lot of operational overhead which is involved here but again all of that comes with a trade-off of providing the best Services best caching experience to our clients so those are some limitations that I I will talk about to okay I think this is a good place to stop um how do you think that went what are your thoughts uh I think it went pretty well what we started off with was with some requirements discussion and all across our design all along our design I would say we were able to abide by those requirements so putting all the granular implementation level perspective into into place and then addressing some interesting questions which you threw at me thank you so much for all those questions and I think we have a design which pretty much satisfied uh highly scalable available and a performant caching service for us yeah what are what are some tips that you would give people who who encounter questions like this in the wild like this didn&#39;t have this didn&#39;t have a particular use case behind it or anything it was just purely theoretical so what are some suggestions that you have for people who get questions like these absolutely yeah um some suggestions that I have for folks and uh something which even I uh when I look back uh you know in the hindsight is um uh try to ask like try to maintain communication with the interviewer as much as possible try to ask as much as questions I would say uh while I did all the questioning thing but I think somewhere in the middle I could have constantly checked with you every now and then periodically to make sure that you are following along because I realize that some places you had to stop me and then ask certain questions uh so as as a candidate I feel it&#39;s my responsibility to keep the interviewer in check keep them carrying along that make sure that they&#39;re following along so that&#39;s one of the things it&#39;s something like a pure backend kind of a system is what I&#39;m trying to say uh you know it&#39;s something not which is a user facing something like a YouTube or maybe an Uber or a Facebook kind of a system so thinking about something which helps you achieve that backend capabilities requires a bit more thought process requires a bit more I would say uh starting from the basic and then evolving the design like I did I started from a single server implementation and then evolved into the distributed world so I think uh that would be a good way if you are not if if you get a question like this which is not super intuitive super user facing kind of thing and it&#39;s more of a backend uh and and all those technological kind of stuffs where you have to go so start Simple Start From the basic and then gradually evolve discuss with the interviewer obviously what they are looking for in which direction they want to go ahead and that should be it I would say yep lovely thank you so much rvy it was wonderful having you on again and I I&#39;m sure this is going to be very useful to people watching from home if I can just add one final thing I would also just talk about consistent hashing uh just to improve the availability I mean that is one thing which I could have talked about but that&#39;s just a follow-up thing anyways that&#39;s my final note gotcha all right thanks so much everyone take care [Music]""}, {""title"": ""ML

dozens more of videos like this at triexcitons over a million people use exponent to Ace their interviews in product management software engineering Engineering Management machine learning data science and much much more get started for free at trixon yeah and we&#39;re excited to have you and I think you have the perfect background for our question today so let&#39;s get right into it our question today is create a data pipeline for near realtime ingestion of Netflix clickstream or playback data um specifically designed for ad hoc monitoring of certain metrics you said we designing the clip stre um injection pipeline yeah um for clickstream or playback data yeah click stream or play data so I&#39;m just going to be yeah um so let me start with uh some clarification questions um just to scope it out so you mentioned about metrics um is there any specific metrics that we are looking at for for this particular pipeline um that we we would like to model uh so basically a variety of metrics that are based on the user clickstream or the playback actions that are performed but which specific ones are up to you yeah Okay cool so it&#39;s basically user I would call it engagement uh then playback data but of course you have U from The Click stream perspective we have a lot of different data data that we can collect from clickstream so we primarily coping out uh only for this um then um I&#39;m going to be asking about um so is there any um uh specific uh do you want to keep like um the solutioning general or are you specifically looking for any spe any to us specifically using looking for any tools and Technologies or any type of platforms to uh model on or keep the Sol keep the solution generated uh yeah that&#39;s a good question uh I think for now we can keep it pretty General but if there are certain specific examples of Frameworks that you would find helpful we can totally pull that in later yeah that that that sounds good because um like I I start with generic but I would definitely um um pick on pure Technologies uh just to um just to accentuate the model a bit so it is uh easier to understand good okay um that&#39;s good okay um so um so from the user engagement um so I&#39;m just going to be expanding a bit on um let meing a generic here I&#39;m going to be AIT expanding on our metrics part because um so the the primary reason the clickstream even clickstream uh clickstream is basically collecting and capturing the user engagement and navigation um the user behaviors and then the interactions of the user with the application so it is going to generate a lot of data about uh how about the user so uh from the user engagement perspective um that could be um so some of the examples being we can we can look at customer churn for example if the user is not the user has been frequently visiting the website for a while but has not been visiting for like last few weeks or so um especially we are looking at uh Netflix Netflix has close to 200 million users and I think it&#39;s growing every day so um so for a Netflix scale uh it is very it&#39;s very difficult to ma uh monitor every user uh but they would really want to understand whom to concentrate on or is there is there a risk of losing set of users in the in the in the next one or two months that means they would want to action and then probably would like to understand what would be their interest so that they can they don&#39;t uh they don&#39;t really lose them to their competitors so those are some of the metrics that we can take from customer to customer churn perspective or it could be a path analysis like what are what is the most popular path a navigation path that the customer is taking uh um and uh what are the most visited pages in the website and uh it can also we can also do some Behavior profiling as well of the customers because this could this could very well be used for learning down the streams you know clustering customers and then um you can be can feed into some recommendation regines as well for recommending some of the movies or uh streams that the user might like so you had mentioned like a variety of different contexts and which uh you would need these metrics to answer certain product questions I was curious what that might be for path analysis for the path analysis so for the path analysis um say for say for say if some of those pages are um you were expecting some say you were you were running a marketing analysis or marketing promotions and you would expect a lot of people to look at that um promotion and then say you so the from the from from your expectation uh you set a target of um uh the pro the promotions beting promotions page getting clicked for example any number of times but you haven&#39;t really seen it happening for a while uh you would wonder why and this click stre data can help you that with that so whether like why what is it what is it that&#39;s blocking the customers from actually navigating to that path is it like too long or is it like say around you had to do seven or eight different clicks to reach there so usually usually for a for a well-designed website anything more than three clicks to reach to a Target State uh is not really good and if it&#39;s more than seven or eight clicks and you&#39;re going to be losing uh at least like 60 70% of the customers there they&#39;re not going to be uh doing that so uh those are some of the analysis that you can do uh why the why the customers are not reaching that particular point or what is blocking them yeah okay perfect yeah those sound like some really valuable product insights and yeah and you mentioned about playback data as well um playback data is um it could be about um number of sessions say what is that um uh the users are streaming right now um um trending trending uh CD movies um and uh it could be about uh information about when they clicked on a pause for example uh when they clicked on a pause um so if this um this could this could also this is actually a really interesting thing uh which I have thought about multiple times as well is um you know um when you when you watch a movie or a series and then you are really interested in it we don&#39;t really pause it that much right we just want to even if it is a series like having eight eight episodes uh I&#39;ve been there you know we just like continuously watch all eight and without even like say whole night right so uh so and but if it is slightly too boring and then is like but you just somehow want to finish it you just like have a lot of B so that kind of like is a is an indicator of uh whether that particular user or customer is really enjoying that movie or or is it like maybe it&#39;s not really that encouraging engaging because um and this can also contribute to the uh the time it took for the customer or the user to watch the series suppose if this if the series or movie is just one hour long but the but the user took like say 3 hours to watch it and if you take into account all the PA times and everything that means like it&#39;s not really a very engaging movie it could be probably a trending at the top for some reason but most of the customers are just like maybe finishing it for for finishing it but they&#39;re not really enjoying it this could even translate they could even translate to a recommendation because you don&#39;t want to recommend recommend a customer or a user um a same type of series because while they have finished it then they may not have enjoyed it so that is another factor to take into account on another feature or variable to take into account for our machine learning or analytics space so uh those are really um um few things I mean of course clickstream clickstream is an ocean and we have a lot of variables in it but these are few things um that we can really look at from the metrics point of view you have any other questions and uh no I thought that was perfect I really liked hearing your like product insights yeah cool thank you to keep it in scope for the click stream we are we&#39;re going to be looking into the data ingestion pipeline itself um so we&#39;re going to be using this models or or the metrics for example I&#39;m going to be I&#39;m planning to use the customer churn um metric just to just to help us exemplify the design so that can ex I can explain how this metrics can flow through uh but the main focus of this design is definitely going to be building that Pipeline and then the different uh different uh um different Pro like say different components that involve in bringing that clickstream events data into our data legs or data warehouse mhm okay yeah cool I&#39;ll um quickly uh jump on to the next section um where I can uh start with um um high level design are you okay with that yeah uhhuh yeah you mentioned you wanted to build out like a pipeline so where do you want to begin with that pipeline design so uh I&#39;m going to categorize this pipeline into different segments so that for the use of our understanding itself is like a a data capture um then um streamy processing uh and then storage and analytics so basically any type of data any any data pipelines will have uh um all these aspects or even um most of this aspects um so basically you want to capture data we&#39;ll it could be if it&#39;s a streaming pipeline we do streaming or if it is like a batch pipeline it will be running in a batch process um and then we obviously want to store and then we want to analyze the data and that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly the reason that we are actually storing the storing the data bringing in the data so uh I&#39;m going to build I&#39;m going to build a uh Pipeline on a high level um that takes into account uh each of those things and then we&#39;ll have some we&#39;ll have the components um that can help us um do that so there are going to be there are a lot of ways of doing it um so I&#39;m going to be starting with an option one and probably we can we can discuss that and then probably and move to option two I can um and then there is obviously um quite a few other ways of doing that as well so the of time I&#39;ll just like start with option one and then we&#39;ll um we&#39;ll move on to other options yeah cool so um so I&#39;m going to be starting with um let&#39;s start with um say we have a users um show the users or using some devices right and then let&#39;s say we are they are browsing some this websites um let me saying I&#39;m just going to keep it small here just like here some website a sample website is what I&#39;m rating here or or in this case it&#39;s like netflix.com right so we have we have the user browsing this website so obviously uh we need to for for a um for for an application of Netflix scale which is geographically distributed uh we need to also consider um uh the user base across different geographies so um there will be the so um there will be a cloud distributions or cloudfront distributions that will be there across so whereas the users can access those links um and then get to that particular website so uh yeah so by so geographical distribution is something that we always need to take into account as well so here the users are uh navigating this website so now for when the users interact with this website that&#39;s when we have the click stream data that gets generated so so when we have this right and um yeah so sorry to jump on I I want to just uh before this I want to discuss one more thing um here as well from the metric point of view right so uh the metrics point of view uh so why we first why we need metrics here is uh to understand um the different to understand and evaluate different options that we have uh that could be always a tradeoff and then the cost factor that come that we need to take into account and versus the performance so it is better to have some metrics uh here so uh from the from a Netflix from a Netflix uh uh like I think the last uh subscribers number of subscribers that I if I vaguely remember it&#39;s just like around 200 million does it sound like a good number to start with for you yeah sure so yes so we have a subscriber base of 200 um 200 million users uh so and out of that let&#39;s say if you have 50% of them uh active on a daily basis right uh so that will be around 100 million 100 million right so and then um so I&#39;m going to be uh saying uh let say roughly in a day uh if we take um around 100,000 seconds I&#39;m just going to be uh very approximate here 100,000 seconds uh and then we have 100 million users and we have 100 million users by 100,000 seconds uh if we if we roughly calculate that um that&#39;s going to be th000 th000 say th000 users per second right um just a second so we can have um for example and this is this is obviously a uniform distribution right so uh we&#39;re not taking into account any spikes here so and that&#39;s not going to be the case all the time so no it&#39;s not really every second there is going to be only thousands thousand users so uh if we apply some 80 20 rule uh where we say 80% of the traffic comes in 20% of the time so we look at that and 20% of th 100,000 if you say 20,000 uh seconds has has whole 100 million users coming in and then if we say 100 million users coming in in a 20 20,000 seconds which is this instead of 100,000 that we calculated uh which could be 5,000 users uh per second which is not a lot as well but it but uh this is just like a minimum but that&#39;s the max could be even like you know um even 50,000 users per second it could be so but these are just like some rough numbers to work with and let&#39;s say each of those uh users like every click or navigation from users um Can generate clickstream events so each of those users so let&#39;s say an user on an average generate 10 events um so that means we are looking at um user generates 10 events that means we looking at um close to 50,000 events per second right the the does those numbers look same to you uh yeah that sounds reasonable reasonable yeah so I mean this is this is quite a bit this quite a large and I think for for a for Netflix scale I think even it could I wouldn&#39;t be surprised even if it is like more than this at some point in time especially when you have like you know very very popular series that&#39;s that everyone is waiting for just released it and just like everyone just like comes in and then uh like uh um yeah watch is that all at one time so that time this number even could go uh much higher so those are some things where yeah right yeah so maybe later on we can talk a little bit about the traffic spikes but for now I guess I giv some context that the system you design should be very scalable yeah yeah sure sure yeah so uh so just just uh sorry switching back to the design here so um so now when we uh look at it we so that there are usually there is usually couple of um couple of models or the methods through which we can collect data so we we we are in this data capture space we still collecting the data this is where the stream events are generated so usually that could be push method or a pull method so a push methods are something where um the servers where these apps are running or where the users are actually browsing that actually can push this data there could be agents demons running on that uh and then that can constantly access our um data infrastructure I&#39;m going to just like call this um um let just like put a container here let&#39;s call this as um data um infra So This Server um the servers um the nodes that are running the running the application uh will have an agent that is running in it uh that can actually constantly push those logs um push those events um to the data infra so we will obviously have some end points or API which the agents might call and then like can push this information um and that is a push model and then for from the pull perspective um we will have our services actually accessing those uh applications and then pulling the data so there are there are advantages and disadvantages in both uh push model is like U it&#39;s uh you just like have the agent running on the servers you don&#39;t really have to worry about it and it keeps on pushing the data uh but uh what is the disadvantage the disadvantage is like it can quickly overwhelm your infra if it&#39;s if you have not CED for it because it can keep on pushing data like I said the peak traffic period uh your your um infrastructure needs to be elastic enough to handle that um but how elastic it would be um and how much it can handle is something that need to be thought through from the PO model perspective uh it&#39;s uh that is the disadvantage it is overcoming because full model it&#39;s you decide when you want to pull for the more data and then you can get more data uh so at the same time it it depends on your polling interval suppose you take the data and then you Tak like say half an hour to process it and then again you pull uh so the half an hour you are going to be polling in only in the intervals of half an hour and then by the time you make sense of those real time click stream events the time is already gone so I mean the insights that you could generate may not be valid anymore because those are real time generator suppose if you want to display some marketing promotions to a user when you do that right uh and uh you respond to it after 1 hour by the time the user is already gone so you don&#39;t really get you don&#39;t get to maximize the that moment uh from the stream data uh so that is that is something to be worried about I mean to be thought about right so it sounds like time is really of the essence here yes right exactly so from the events from the events uh streaming perspective it&#39;s really the time right so of course of course we can get some some of those uh training movies you know all those Behavior profiling those are all more aggregation data that you can do uh even the customer turn as well but some of those things like you know uh in terms of the example that I explained uh time is very important so there could be lot of metrics where time is very important so here uh I&#39;m going to be uh starting with um an API so I&#39;m going to start with an API Gateway so so there going to be API I&#39;m going to be exposing an API end point where the servers can push the data to we have the API Gateway uh and then so this is the data collection Point um so we are getting we collecting the data from our servers and I&#39;m having a Lambda or any type of processing that you can do uh the pre-processor so that you can uh you can collect the data and then like um send it to before you can pre-process it before sending it to the rest of the infrastructure right um so like I said there are few options that you can do here uh one is uh a CFA uh the kfka is streaming platform um that&#39;s that&#39;s really resilient and fall tolerant and uh it can scale um pretty fast for our uh for our use case it&#39;s like 50,000 events per second uh so CFA can really use um can be used here so one of the uh the CFA and then uh spark a spark is a distributed computing platform um which you can um which can be used to um analyze those events so the spark has a spark streaming module the Kafka and Spark uh work nicely together uh so we have a CFA the CFA so we have the events that are coming in the huge number of events we Pro we prop preprocess it and then uh send it to Kafka and Kafka acts as a buffer so you don&#39;t really so once the events reach kafa like even if the even if the consumers so this is a producer and this is a consumer and consumers are not online kfka can still store the data and then when the consumer comes online and it can pick up the data so we are not really losing much data here um so the we can keep pushing the data irrespec to of other consumers are active so uh spark has a spark streaming uh that can plug into CFA and then like up start consuming the um events and uh when we look at any type of logic that needs to be written uh we can use a spark programming to write that and uh and uh and uh it is very performant and it works in the concept of micro batches suppose um spark is something uh uh it works in micro batches it cannot give you a subsec latency suppose if you are if you have events or if you have metrics that requires subsec latency you can think about uh instead of spark uh we can use Flink as well Flink is uh also a realtime distributed computing platform so uh and it and but it can give you millisecond latency and it&#39;s very very performant that uh and so the it is really useful for cases where uh the time is really important right then then um I&#39;m going to be bringing in so obviously for with any kind of uh events inje you get the events and then you process it uh but you also want to store that data and that&#39;s where the data Lake comes in so uh data Lake here so the data Lake uh is made up of multiple layers so this whenever you get some any of those events you would want to ideally store it in any of those object stores uh for example uh so here um you have um you have data legs are usually B usually uh based off uh different layers so you will have different um different buckets say for example it could be a raw raw layer raw layer is where you store the raw EV and then it will move to um a processed layer for example and then that could be an access layer so these are different um different data Lake principles where you bring in an events and then you you always store that um in a data Lake as well so for further analytics purposes uh can you tell me like why a data Lake instead of other types of data stores so uh we are going to be so uh having other type of data source as well but data L is primarily important for or use case when we say you know we want to do a customer CH analysis or a behavior profiling uh we need to have that data stored over time for example you want to see like weeks or months worth of analysis of understanding the frequency of visits of the customer so how do we do that um because we can&#39;t really store uh infinitely in kfka cfast gives you a storage for S days um and uh you it&#39;s primarily used for stream processing and Analysis if you want to do any type of historical analysis you it is it is it is recommended to store that data in a data Lake and then uh so at any point in time you want you can actually access this raw layer for example and then um and then do some analysis on top of it okay got it yeah yeah so but uh this is not all we will we will obviously will have uh and also the good thing about this data legs is you can run some analytics straight out of the box for example in case of AWS you can have Athena that is a service that can run straight on top of S3 and you can straight away start running queries the analyst can run can run queries on top of uh raw data or even usually usually the access is not provided for the raw data and it is provided is provided only in the access layers uh so the analyst can run uh queries on top of um S3 data without having to do anything it is just like straight away they can start doing some analysis uh but from the no SQL perspective or from the from the realtime perspective it is all it is recommended to um store some of those um key Insight or the real time insights that you would want to uh actually uh expose to the customers in a more performant database uh for example in a no SQL uh if I take an example so Amazon has a Dynamo DB which you can which can be used um yeah so so here so when you when you start when you bring in those events and then the buffer it in Kafka and the spark spark or Flink processes those events and the anal the analysis if you want it to be uh accessed real time it can be stored in a nosql database you can connect it to a nosql database no SQL database is very performant uh and uh you can access data um you can store millions of columns and it doesn&#39;t really have a schema so that is a that is a good thing about it uh so you can uh and it it gives you a fast reads as well and fast rides as well so you can store that in a real time so even if you get a 50,000 UNS per second no no SQL uh databases are the ones that are going to help uh store those events in a very performant way suppose if you have a relational database out for this uh it&#39;s going to be a bottleneck CU that&#39;s going to be that&#39;s going to decide how perform a is going to be your pipeline even if link processes it in millisecs and you store it in a you you access a relational database to store it that&#39;s going to be a bottleneck and it is one the pipeline is going to be as fast as the database uh that is going to uh process it faster right so uh moving on so we can have uh like analytics as well running on top uh of this so here if we so we have so so we can have uh um for any type of analytics like I said um Athena is another Athena is a service that we can use that can directly run on top of uh um the data legs and then provide some useful insights uh or you you so the no SQL no SQL databases like I mentioned it could be helpful in doing some certain realtime insights uh but you also but but that doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t really use any of the relational databases relational databases are really important as well you want to store some facts and dimensions uh for historical analytical olap queries uh so you would want to store that data that&#39;s where since if you had stored this uh raw data that&#39;s another use case if you want to store if you store these events in um uh in a data Lake and later on you can have those connectors uh you can have those services for example you can have another service here um that can get the data from here and then load it into your uh load it into your uh relational database for example and that can that can serve some of the analytical purposes now the main thing to note is this is not in the critical path so the these are is like a parallel stream of parallel stream of parall pipeline that is happening so uh so it&#39;s not going to any way affect your uh performance in terms of the inje right so um so when you have it in no SQL uh you can also uh run some um so there are some there are uh there are some more processes or some more um analytics that you want to run on uh no SQL you can run that as well and then probably publish it to some service called know even if you want to put it in an elastic search or the user to search on something or if you want to again put it into another uh S3 or rdbms depends on the type of storage if you want to have some analytical queries running on top of it you would either put it in an S3 or rdbms or if you want to expose that data to a user for example you want to um show in an UI like a marketing promotion uh then you will have these uh like Loop it back to the UI uh and then like show a popup or something um having that promotion or if you want to if you want user to have the ability to search based on something maybe elastic search is another service that you can use where uh you can just push in this data the analytical data uh that can help some of those searches were there any other components to this pipeline that you wanted to add yeah so um just in the of time I&#39;m going to be as like I said I like few options there are few options um I discussed about a CFA so Amazon here Amazon has Amazon managed streaming for CFA that&#39;s what I used here um along with the spark and Flink which are pretty fun Source um so this is not the only way to do it we can have Amazon has um if if I just stick to AWS there is a pipeline called aw and there is a component called kesis AWS kesis is another um uh even streaming uh platform that we can use instead of Kafka that that goes well with the actually with the clickstream data and also with the iot uh devices so it is primarily designed for that so kesis has uh uh few services so so this this is kesis so this is kesis streams which which you can think of it as like uh um kind of a CFA uh so which can connect to which can actually bring in which can which used in the data cture space uh where it can connect with it can get data and it exposes the end points where the agents can push the data so the is very useful for clickstream rents as well a lot of companies use clickstream and for this stream as well and there is this data analytics uh can is data analytics that you can use that can nicely go along with kesis stream suppose if you want to run some streaming queries on top of the clickstream uh events that you are receiving on the fly without even storing anywhere uh you can do that using KES analytics those are some simple queries that you can write and then uh and then you can just push it to um for example any of the no SQL or any or even to the back to the UI uh if you if you if those metrics are really time sensitive and you want to really act on it right and there is another interesting interesting one just just one more thing is this fire host uh so this fire hose is uh is like kind of a buffer so suppose if you you you Pro so always it&#39;s good practice that you that you want to act on some of those realtime events and then push push it to uh uh and then act on it as quick as possible but also you don&#39;t want to lose that information always you want to load it to it somewhere in your data lake so that at a later point in time you can always come back and then run some historical analysis on top of it so that&#39;s where the fire host could be really helpful fire host you can have uh have you can set the time for example 15 minutes so every 15 minutes you can configure it to push it to h a lake uh any of the raw buckets raw buckets or any buckets that you would want or it can even it has a quite a few destinations it can even push it to elastic search it can even push it to Red shift for example red shift is another data housing solution uh that nicely fits into this analytical Paradigm okay amazing thanks so much for telling us about this um like huge variety of Technologies I thought that was really informative uh I think this is a great place for us to pause um so I&#39;d love to hear from you like what did you think of this interview what do you think went well versus what do you think you would want to change or do differently into future I think overall uh we covered quite we covered one specific um like one or two specific ways to do things uh the uh so the probably if we one of the things that we could uh we could also add on to this is like discuss about the cost cost Factor based on the metrics and also like different there are different tradeoffs or uh different trade-offs or challenges in this pipeline um that could be discussed you know in terms of the schema Evolution uh in terms of uh what type of format that you would use to um uh use for this clickstream data and also uh you know in terms of um how how the how how the metrics could be modeled uh you know um there could be some data modeling that we can get into in terms of the customer CH as well uh we can but obviously we can&#39;t really cover everything like I said uh the the the pipeline creation itself is driven from the business process uh so um based on what is required uh you you make your data engineering pipeline as flexible as possible uh like this this particular pipeline is more generic it can bring in any data but how it would be modeled for a specific use case uh you will you will think about all the things whether you want to act on it on a time or it is a historical or is it more of a rdbms or a more SQL related things based on that will be CH Technologies yeah I agree with a lot of those points um I really liked that you tried to reference like your highle design principles whenever possible for like motivating Your Design so for example what you just said about um trying to design something that&#39;s as flexible as possible I also like that before you actually jumped into the technical details you talked a little bit about like the business context behind like why you would pick certain metrics like what in the end do we care about and like why are we tracking these metrics in the first uh place um yeah so that was super helpful um I also liked that you were able to provide like a variety of different like specific technologies that you would use at stage of the pipeline um I think the tradeoff on that is that when you mention a very specific technology it&#39;s helpful to them back up and explain like okay what is the general principle behind this so if you&#39;re using a particular like database like I can explain that like this is no SQL and why would we use no SQL here and there&#39;s a lot of trade-offs there to discuss right so um I think you very briefly touched upon this the idea of um schema Evolution so for no SQL Solutions right like um when you then change your schema in the future because maybe you want to do new types of data analysis uh it&#39;s a lot easier to do that than with a relational database right but on the other hand like you see the trade-off that your data is not going to be as strictly validated as if it was in a relational database right y uh yep and one last thing I would have loved to hear a little bit more about and of course it&#39;s hard to fit this in there&#39;s already so much info here uh is Maybe the general like do you see any potential bottlenecks in this system and how fault tolerant is it overall and what you put any measures in place to try to like improve the fall tolerance and um reduce any bottlenecks yeah but other than that I thought you did a fantastic job so thank you so much for being here with us today caric cool thank you thanks for thanks for having me here yeah of course and thanks everybody for watching if you have any upcoming interviews good luck [Music]""}, {""title"": ""Tell me about a time you failed - Behavioral Interview Question.

I don&#39;t know, I think I know myself better than I ever have, And so what I make kind of reflects that, I guess. And I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m flailing as much in trying to figure out who I am. I was sick all the time.  When I did COLORS, i had a really bad cold, and i remember being so upset because i was so excited to do it, and then i was sick and I was like, \u201cNo! I\u2019m going to sound so bad and no one\u2019s going to like it, and no one\u2019s going to want to watch it.\u201d I just was really nervous. It ended up being really huge for me. I think it was my introduction for a lot of people. I think a lot of people found me off of that. Well, creating music is such a healing thing. When you get to write a song, it&#39;s like a way of being heard and seen, even by yourself. I just feel like it&#39;s the most perfect way to express yourself, And it feels so rewarding, and it feels so freeing and cathartic. it&#39;s been such a help in my, my life, and my, you know, mental health journey. I really used to not like songwriting, and I really kind of wanted to do anything but. I think that&#39;s because I didn&#39;t think I was very good, and that was very frustrating, and it took me a long time when I would write. my brother was such a good writer, and so quick, like immediately. He&#39;s kind of a genius, I think that that was just challenging for me because I was like, &quot;how could I ever compare to finneas as a musician? He&#39;s the best to ever do it.&quot; throughout the years, Finneas has only ever said that I&#39;m a good writer. it was only my own brain. I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time, but not really in the scheme of like, life. And I&#39;m only like 22 right now, and that feels so old to me, because I started when I was 14, But... I really do believe that in the future I will look back at this period of time, And this album, and truly believe that it was the most honest that I&#39;d been and the most like myself that I had been. I&#39;m not playing a character right now, and that feels really good. the Beatles is the, you know, what I can blame for my And Finneas&#39; way of songwriting, honestly, in so many ways, But specifically, the way that we layer vocals and all the harmonies and... all the chords, like we, that was, that was really our biggest, I think, influence growing up. I mean, the way that the Beatles did all their harmonies was so... just like nothing else had ever been. They were just so cool and so weird and unexpected and beautiful. I think that was a big thing. And then, also, I got to give a lot of credit to growing up in a choir. Finneas and I both grew up in choirs. it&#39;s the most beautiful thing in the world And I learned so much about harmony. I also was just so moved by that. That was, that was one of our first like, things that we had was like, all the vocals, and all the layering. And we&#39;ve stuck with it. We still do it, Just how we used to, which is cool. I think of them as kind of like sister songs. &#39;skinny&#39; was made first, and to be real, &#39;what was I made for?&#39; would never have been written if we hadn&#39;t made &#39;skinny&#39;. I\u2019ve said it before, but this was like a period of time where Finneas and I were very uninspired and had really low self-esteem. And we hadn&#39;t written one whole song for the album at all, and we&#39;d been working for like months, and we&#39;d made pieces of stuff, but kind of were nervous that we didn&#39;t have it in us anymore. It was like the end of December and Finneas and I got into... kind of like a, not necessarily an argument, but like a very intense, long, serious conversation. I&#39;m pretty sure that at the end of that, Finneas just got out his guitar, and it was the electric guitar, and he plugged it into the speakers, so it had that exact sound that&#39;s already on the record. I had the handheld mic and I just started just making stuff up. we wrote that whole song that night, and that was a big moment for us. It was also really special because so many of the lyrics were things that I had been feeling and hadn&#39;t been able to see that I was even feeling, or at least express. Then writing about them, And it was really spectacular. And then, honestly, like, 2 or 3 weeks later, we saw the &#39;Barbie&#39; movie and we were told to write the &#39;Barbie&#39; song. We sat down and wrote almost all of &#39;what was I made for?&#39; In like under two hours, if not one hour. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just really special to think about that Those songs wouldn&#39;t be anything without each other in a way. A lot of visuals come to mind when I think of &#39;bittersuite&#39;. The ending part was all it was for a long time. And then Finneas texted me a video, which was he was like, &quot;dude, look what I found.&quot; And it was this track that we had just forgotten that we&#39;d made at some random point, That was, then what now is the beginning of &#39;bittersuite&#39;, but then it was just this like little random thing that we made, and then we put them together and made them into one song. I remember listening to it in my pool when we finished it. I was brought to this other place in my mind, which is really interesting. I think also &#39;birds of a feather&#39; is very... I&#39;m very sensory about that one. I have a lot of memories tied to that song, Not great ones and then also good ones. and it&#39;s also a song that I was really nervous about putting out because I didn&#39;t know if it was good or not. I really loved it, but I was kind of like, &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me that&#39;s going to love it though.&quot; Because sometimes that can happen, And it&#39;s been amazing to like, hear people&#39;s love for it and see people really feeling connected to it. The early on years touring, and the little tiny rooms that I would play. As soon as I would finish the show, I wouldn&#39;t even go backstage, There wasn&#39;t even a backstage, I would just go into the crowd and I&#39;d meet everyone. Everyone. I would give everyone a hug, and I&#39;d talk to them, and I would take a picture with everyone and sign whatever they had. I think those were such important moments in my life and who I am as an artist. without those, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am, and I don&#39;t think I would feel how I feel, and have the connection that I have with the fans. Advice is a tricky thing, It&#39;s so hard to like, listen to. The day after the Grammys, that first time, Alicia Keys called me, and she said, &quot;don&#39;t be embarrassed for being dope.&quot; And that was very special and impactful. So thanks Alicia. That&#39;s a great question, These are good questions. I think, you know when you find your people when you don&#39;t feel stupid. you hang out with the wrong people, but you don&#39;t necessarily know they&#39;re the wrong people, And you kind of leave feeling like, &quot;I wasn&#39;t being funny enough, I wasn&#39;t being cool enough, I feel bad about this thing that I said, I feel embarrassed about this thing that I did.&quot; And the right people will not make you feel bad about being yourself. that feeling of acceptance and love makes you feel so confident and so good. And at that point, it doesn&#39;t matter what anybody else thinks. when I&#39;m with a group of friends that I love so much and that make me feel safe and seen, I am not thinking one time about if people think we&#39;re being annoying or cringey or stupid or loud. I laugh at everything, I&#39;m laughing at literally everything. It doesn&#39;t even barely have to be funny. I love to laugh. I would say keep doing what you&#39;re doing. I think you did a pretty good job. And... don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. And don&#39;t... be embarrassed. keep being Billie and you&#39;ll be okay. I forgot that sometimes. So don&#39;t forget. And also well done. Yeah. Congrats on the... on the Grammys. Thanks, colors. see you next time.""}, {""title"": ""Billie Eilish returns for the first episode of our new interview series A COLORS CLOSE-UP."", ""description"": ""Global icon Billie Eilish ( @BillieEilish ) returns to COLORS for an intimate, in-depth conversation, in the first episode of our new interview series A COLORS CLOSE-UP.\n\nFollow\n\u25b6 Stream: https://colors.lnk.to/allshowscxs\n\u25b6 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/billieeilish\n\u25b6 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@billieeilish\n\u2014\n\nCheck out our curated playlists: \n\u25b6 ALL COLORS SHOWS: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWa4R2I19VH7Mtxo3VvqwnNlXgLpf4_d3 \n\u25b6 FEEL | A COLORS PLAYLIST: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWa4R2I19VH6mND1HUBeHJN1NMzi6VAFR\n\u25b6 MOVE | A COLORS PLAYLIST: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWa4R2I19VH7WEZgUsNUMPQRGLfiyIHJz \n\nLivestream: \n\u25b6 24/7 | A COLORS STREAM: https://colors.lnk.to/247\n\nFollow COLORS:\n\u25b6 Apparel Shop: https://colors.lnk.to/shopcxs\n\u25b6 On Socials: https://colors.lnk.to/socials\n\u25b6 On Spotify: https://colors.lnk.to/Spotify\n\u25b6 On Apple Music: https://colors.lnk.to/applemusic\n\u25b6 On the Web: https://colorsxstudios.com\n\u25b6 Newsletter: https://colorsxstudios.com/newsletter\n\nCOLORSxSTUDIOS is a unique aesthetic music platform showcasing exceptional talent from around the globe.
