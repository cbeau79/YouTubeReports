      "subtitles": "this is the 2024 Lexus LC 500 Cabriolet and this car has a lot of great things going for it beautiful styling naturally aspirated V8 gorgeous interior all of that has been true since this car came out like 6 years ago but the 24 LC has been updated with some important new changes and I think they make this version abs absolutely the one to have today I&#39;ll review the lc500 Cabriolet and explain why and show you all of this car&#39;s quirks and [Applause] features today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern Enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has hosted more than 20,000 car auctions of special cool and interesting cars like this and this and this and this so if you&#39;re looking to buy or sell an Enthusiast car do it on cars and bids all right time for the quirks and features of the LC 500 starting with a brief overview namely an explanation this is lexus&#39;s luxury performance convertible you probably don&#39;t associate the Lexus brand with performance or or convertibles but they do have this now there are many great things about the Lexus lc500 especially for the 24 model year but the greatest is this engine the lc500 has a 5 L naturally aspirated V8 with about 470 horsepower and about 400 lb feet of torque one of the last great na V8 engines to exist in the entire car world is installed in this car it&#39;s great on paper the numbers are fantastic and it sounds pretty good too take a [Music] listen now this car is also offered in hybrid form they sell something called the lc500h that has a hybrid V6 with about 350 horsepower do not get this engine no matter what you do don&#39;t get that powertrain it&#39;s more efficient but you lose the primary benefit of this car which is one of the very last na V8s in the entire car world and a great one at that skip the lc500h please and Beyond the powertrain there are other great benefits of this car for one thing it&#39;s rear wheeel drive you could totally see Lexus coming out with a luxury performance convertible and then making it front-wheel drive negating any enthusiest interest in the car but that&#39;s not the case here rear wheeel drive and it&#39;s absolutely beautiful the lc500 is a gorgeous car every line every angle it is truly fantastic fantastically designed a beautiful and truly desirable car you turn your head and look every time you see one on the street it&#39;s amazing that Lexus gave us the LFA Supercar which was not particularly attractive and then years later came out with this much more beautiful for far less money the LFA may still be the cool sporty Lexus but this is the Nic looking one but all of these things have been true about the Lexus LC since it came out back in 2018 it&#39;s always had the na8 it&#39;s always been rear wheeel drive and it&#39;s always been beautiful so you&#39;re thinking why am I watching this crap why don&#39;t I just go turn on throttle house well the answer is the newest LC the 2024 model has received one tremendously important upgrade the infotainment system now again before you switch over to Thomas and James let me tell you why this is important since the LC first came out 6 years ago it has used lexus&#39;s remote touch interface which is the single worst piece of automotive equipment perpetrated on the consumer since the handcrank starter basically it was like a computer mouse that you had to move around to select things while all other vehicles were making do with touch screens where you just tap on something in the Lexus LC and similar Lexus models you would have to scroll around on a trackpad and perfectly click on what you were looking for while also driving down the road it was terrible total trash the worst infotainment system in the history of the car industry including those really early BMW ones where the screen had about 11 pixels and three colors finally they have ditched it other Lexus models have gotten rid of remote touch over the last few years and I wasn&#39;t sure if that change was going to make its way into the LC because well this car isn&#39;t very popular but for 24 it now has a touchscreen lexus&#39;s terrible infotainment is gone and it is replaced with a sensible reasonable situation and you got to figure this won&#39;t last for very long the Lexus LC has not exactly been a strong seller it&#39;s an expensive car with a narrow Market segment and frankly it&#39;s had six years of sales to already take place now we&#39;re down to the very end of the production run you have to assume Lexus won&#39;t let this car go on much longer and we finally got the good technology so I say this is the one to have because it finally has great Tech it&#39;s the end of the line it&#39;s going to be low production low volume this is the special one and in 20 years when we&#39;re talking about the Lexus LC and its big na8 people are always going to say yeah well you know you got to get a 24 or later car in order to have the best one that&#39;s this and this will be the best one now if you want it of course it&#39;s going to be pricey the coupe with a fixed roof starts around $100,000 this car the convertible starts around 106 not cheap but a lot of great benefits in this car especially now so now that we&#39;ve established this is a desirable car let&#39;s go through its cirks and features starting with getting inside you walk up you can see the door handle is flush with the body you unlock the doors the door handle pops out and reveals a Lexus logo that had been hidden until then which is kind of cool next you open up the door and in this particular LC you can see one of the most beautiful Interiors in any Japanese car frankly in just about any car on sale today absolutely gorgeous layout but also the colors in here are fantastic these cream white seats with these royal blue accents and the spiderweb like stitching on the seats everything looks really really beautiful in here very cool and very high-end this interior is part of a new upgrade that Lexus is offering on the 24 LC called a bespoke build interior you can see the plaque here that says Lexus bespoke build the thinking is you get more personalization and customization options so you can go wild with your interior and make it beautiful and change colors and stitching to your heart&#39;s content and this car displays some of what&#39;s possible if looks fantastic but beyond the colors and the stitching in this interior just the regular materials that you get in every Lexus LC are absolutely fantastic you can see in the center control stack here this beautiful sort of platinum Chrome that just looks great a lot better than plastic or aluminum it&#39;s a gorgeous look and they have it all throughout the center the center console you can see near the shift lever this gorgeous look and feel material in here I also so love how the door handles are just sort of floating on the door panel they&#39;re not integrated into the design Instead This Platinum like husk just sort of sticks out and you grab it to get out of the car it looks very cool even the glove box opener button in this car is attractive and gentle you press it and without a sound the glove box is delivered it&#39;s a very beautiful feeling even something as stupid and simple as opening up the glove box this interior really is fantastic but there are many more quirks to cover here so let&#39;s start with the dial next to the gauge cluster that&#39;s sort of sticking out from the gauge cluster shroud you can see it here this is your drive mode dial and the cool thing about this is when you adjust it the gauge cluster screen adjusts in pretty cool way you go from normal to sport you can see here it gets sportier then you go into Sport Plus and it gets even sportier still which is pretty neat the other neat thing is if you switch it the other direction to go into comfort and Eco it also changes in those modes and Eco even replaces the engine temperature gauge with an Eco dial as you can see but the coolest thing about the gauge cluster in this car it moves check this out this button on the steering wheel you push it and then the gauge cluster moves over to provide you with a new screen that gives vehicle information and various different readouts and settings that you can change press it again and the cluster moves back into the center this is not just some screen that&#39;s moving around it is a physical dial that&#39;s moving in place which is so cool Lexus first had this in the LFA superar and since then it&#39;s trickled down into some other sporty models like this and the is sports sedan and it is just a cool feature and a wonderful Quirk now also worth pointing out the switch over on the other side of the gauge Club cluster this will put you in snow mode if you want or turn on and off your traction control but anyway next we move into the center console here which is largely the same as the previous Lexus LC although you lose that trackpad like I had mentioned that you had for the remote Touch system since we&#39;ve now moved on to a touch screen otherwise fairly similar fairly familiar controls from the old LC in here although unquestionably the weirdest one is the control for the heated seats to turn on your heated seats you press a button right here and then that brings up a menu in the screen that lets you turn the heated seats on or off if you&#39;re going to include a heated seat button just let me push the button to turn on the heated seats come on Lexus why turn this into a two-step process especially since you already have a button they were so close to getting it and then they didn&#39;t they gave you the physical button but you still have to use the screen now fortunately for the climate control that is not integrated into the screen never has been in Alexus LC instead you have it here below the screen with these nice sort of platinum Chrome switches which are all very luxurious to press and to look at and of course it means no stupid menus to go through here for your climate control now speaking of the climate system one unusual item in this car is the climate vents you can see one to the left of the steering wheel fairly standard one to the right on the passenger side also standard in the midle middle you only have one vent which isn&#39;t that unusual it&#39;s a fairly small car small interior you don&#39;t need more but you have more above the glove box you can see two more climate vents meaning that the passenger side of this interior has three and if they wanted to use the center one four which seems like a little bit of climate vent Overkill in a convertible but that&#39;s what they&#39;ve done so that&#39;s how it is now back to the center console here couple of other interesting things for one the cup holder clearly an afterthought it&#39;s located here under this panel you push it open it up you only have one cup holder and it&#39;s pretty small but there is a second hidden cup holder check this out if you move the center armrest back push this down and move it back you have another cup holder here it&#39;s square but you can stick a drink in here if you need to and a pinch if you have two cups that need holding also in this center console area you have a button marked View with a camera on it unfortunately it pulls up the stupidest camera view in history where a camera like floats around the LC with an egg shape and you can&#39;t position it where you want this is lexus&#39;s version of a 3D camera it&#39;s terrible compared to other brands where you can swipe and exactly show what you want to see this is what the LC has hey at least it&#39;s not in the remote touch controller screen anymore now the really neat party trick in this center console is the power top operation which is hidden under this little Mound it looks like this is here is just a handrest where you&#39;d stick your hand while you&#39;re controlling say the stereo volume or the track or turning on the heated seats but below this handrest you flip it up and there&#39;s your power top control and you push that button and it&#39;s pretty simple the top goes up and as you can see it&#39;s quite fast it goes up unusually quickly for basically any convertible even though this is a somewhat large car it&#39;s a small top it doesn&#39;t cover that much area and it just goes up and then it&#39;s in place and same deal when you want to put it down just push the switch in the other direction the top unlatches itself and goes down as quickly as possible very Speedy process and you can do it while you&#39;re driving as long as you&#39;re going a fairly slow speed now the other control that&#39;s hidden under this little panel is this button which will raise or lower all of the windows at once this is fantastic you push it up and all of the windows go up the two front windows and the little windows for the back seats this can be helpful if you just put up the roof it started raining you don&#39;t have to individually put up all the windows one button will do it all and it can be useful if you just put the roof down and you want all the windows down at once push that button and they all go down or of course if you&#39;re transitioning from Street driving to the freeway with the top down you want the Windows Up For Less wind noise well you can do that it is a very cool feature to have one button that can raise or lower all of the windows but anyway other quirks in this interior for one thing the gear selector is a bit unusual if you want to put the car into drive you move it to the left so towards you in the driver&#39;s seat and then down and you&#39;re in drive you want to go into reverse you move it to the left and then up and you&#39;re in reverse and neutral is just straight to the left if you want to engage manual mode you pull it down when you&#39;re in drive and then you can manually shift using the pedals on the steering wheel Park is just a button next to all this stuff it&#39;s a fairly standard gear selector situation in Toyota and Lexus models especially hybrids but if you&#39;re not familiar with it it can be a little unusual also interesting a little quirky when you lock the doors when you press the door lock button there&#39;s a little light mounted on the door panel where a physical door lock would be and it turns green you&#39;d think it would turn red to say locked but instead it turns green which means locked seems a little bit odd and that light is weird generally but it&#39;s there a nice little Quirk now Last Thing Worth pointing out setting up is the infotainment system itself like I said new touchcreen that&#39;s the big news for 24 and frankly well it&#39;s okay it&#39;s actually not that great of an infotainment system it does exactly what you&#39;d expect it to doesn&#39;t really have any crazy exciting cool features Worth showing off but it is responsive it&#39;s a large screen very intuitive to use very simple just not particularly exciting or thrilling in any way still dramatically better than what they had before next up let&#39;s move on to the back back seats which as you can see are tremendously tiny these are like the Tinker toy back seats absolutely laughably small nobody could ever possibly dream of getting inside them they even come with this ridiculously tiny florat that almost looks like kind of a joke but it&#39;s there to go along with the ridiculously tiny back seats now couple of interesting things worth noting for one the seat belts come out of the center and then buckled to the side which is the opposite of how they work in most other cars including the front seats in this one so that&#39;s kind of an interesting Quirk now the seat belts also have a feature where you can pin them to the seat uses a magnet it kind of keeps them in place I guess because you don&#39;t want them flopping around when you&#39;re driving fast with the top down the winds blowing and also you would do that because no one will ever actually use these seat belts so you might as well just kind of keep them in place now the other thing you&#39;ll notice back here it&#39;s only two seats one on each side you don&#39;t have a center seat in the middle I can only imagine how uncomfortable that would be instead you have a speaker for the mark levenson sound system in the middle which I&#39;m sure provides a great sound experience while your knees are getting crushed now also worth pointing out back here on the backs of the front headrest you have the Lexus L embossed into the leather although I think this is more a commentary on what type of person you are if you&#39;re stuck in in the back seat of this Cod ha anyway the other the other thing worth noting back here is the wind deflector mounted on top of the back seats you can see it here it&#39;s a tremendously small piece of glass fixed in place you can&#39;t take it off you wouldn&#39;t think it would do all that much but they wouldn&#39;t have put it there if it didn&#39;t it&#39;s supposed to keep wind kind of blowing over the interior and not directly in your face while you&#39;re driving with the roof down and finally we move outside the Lexus LC to talk through its exterior quirks and features starting with the tail lights which are very cool you can see there&#39;s like a series of L&#39;s I guess for Lexus sort of going through the tail lights like a 3D image it&#39;s a very cool look when you get up close with one of these and look into the tail lights when they&#39;re on I also like the turn signals back here this vertical turn signal design is very eye-catching very different from what you might expect in a car like this and same deal up front you have a similar vertical turn signal design up here again a little bit head turning a little bit daring and exciting which is kind of cool I also love the front headlight situation especially the running light where you have this led it&#39;s almost a check mark kind of starting at the Bodywork and then going inside into the lighting cluster it&#39;s a cool element that again adds to the neat and sort of Daring styling of this car finally last thing worth talking about is the trunk the cargo area situation you open up the trunk and you can see well it&#39;s quite small actually surprisingly small because this car is one of those ones that old guys take to the golf course and so they would want to be able to put their clubs in it but there&#39;s not a lot of space you could probably fit a set of golf clubs in here but you&#39;ll be mashing it down which nobody really likes to do so a little bit of a tight trunk situation but that&#39;s the compromise you make to drive around in Lexus LC Beauty all right driving the updated 2024 Lexus lc500 driving with the roof on right now just for sound purposes but I&#39;ve been driving this car around with the roof off and it is glorious it is so nice just the wind rushing in in this fantastic car that looks great and feels great so let&#39;s get into it starting with the powertrain which is absolutely excellent this 5 L naturally aspirated V8 is one of the very last engines of its kind that still exists in the whole world and boy is it nice excellent power on tap you just drop your foot a little bit and you get a great throttle response really quick to respond ah and the sound is just so good and there might be piped in sound I don&#39;t know but it just sounds like an old school na8 like exactly what you&#39;d want from a exciting enjoyable Fun sports car it&#39;s just such a neat place to be and then the powertrain is a fantastic [Music] compliment Roar now I will say that I think the transmission could use a little bit of help unless you&#39;re deep into a sport mode it&#39;s a little slow to respond but it is a nice and smooth and comfortable transmission uh which is a which is a great benefit now one other nice thing about this car when you&#39;re cruising around if you got the roof up you don&#39;t really hear all that much going on now it&#39;s not bentle convertible quiet where somehow you really hear nothing even though it still has a clothed softtop but you don&#39;t hear much and so you do have a pretty luxurious experience the exception is ride quality it&#39;s not that rough especially if you&#39;re in a comfort mode or a custom mode where you&#39;ve chosen a comfort suspension but it&#39;s not like a Bentley or like an S-Class Cabriolet this was intended to be a sportier car it was specifically designed to be sporer more engaging than your typical Lexus and so even in its most comfortable setting it doesn&#39;t beat you up but it&#39;s harsher than a luxury car it doesn&#39;t feel like some comfortable thing that&#39;s costing you that isn&#39;t really the goal of the Lexus LC it was supposed to be a sporty car and it feels like that and it sounds like that and it has the power like that like all of the boxes are checked except the brand name you think you think four seater Lexus convertible you&#39;re going to be getting a comfortable ride well not quite I&#39;ve been driving this around all week here in some Southern California where there&#39;s a lot of cars on the road a lot of special cars and um I haven&#39;t seen a single other one they&#39;re just they&#39;re just not common you you can you have a pretty rare and special head turning and exciting car and it&#39;s gorgeous to look at now one other thing worth noting uh is the steering with this car which isn&#39;t as sporty as you might be thinking if you if you&#39;re looking at the rest of the specs the steering is a little slow and a little over assisted and that way they went a little bit more Lexus and even if you go into plus mode or a comfort mode with the sportiest steering possible it&#39;s just not that sporty this car kind of lives in an interesting middle ground between luxury and Sport and it&#39;s more on the sporty side but it&#39;s not entirely and completely sport only uh and that&#39;s definitely clear with like the steering the handling is pretty good it stays relatively flat but it&#39;s clear that this car wasn&#39;t designed to be a dynamic Masterpiece it is a good car it is a sporty car but it is not you know a 911 let&#39;s put it that way although it certainly looks better than a 911 overall I&#39;m really impressed with this car I&#39;ve always loved the Lexus LC since it first came out and I first reviewed it in Connecticut like 7 years ago and I just think this is the best version and I think it&#39;s sad that it&#39;s only coming at the very end we finally got the good infotainment you know they finally added a convertible we still have the na8 the convertible came a few years ago but it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t there immediately like they finally got all the ingredients right to just make it as good as humanly possible it&#39;s just a neat combination of things that we probably won&#39;t see again especially considering how sales have gone um the the days of these bigger coups are CPS convertibles luxury cars are kind of coming to an end in favor of SUVs and sportier vehicles and so this was a this was a fun thing to have for a few years and they&#39;ve now just made it the best version of itself and I think it&#39;s a special car I think it&#39;s a truly special car and so that&#39;s the 2024 Lexus LC 500 this car is special it&#39;s always been special but now that the infotainment isn&#39;t awful and now that the production numbers are particularly low this one is especially special and now it&#39;s time to give the updated Lexus LC a Doug score and the Doug score is here 67 out of 100 which puts the LC 500 convertible at the top of this list of competitors and with good reason is this car is really really desirable the LC has always been awesome beautiful fast exciting with a tremendously enjoyable engine but the updated technology finally solves its only weak spot Lexus must be frustrated that such a fantastic car has found such a small Niche group of buyers but such as life with cars in this segment these days nobody really wants an expensive big Cooper Convertible but if you do don&#39;t buy a new SL don&#39;t buy a new BMW 8 series buy a new Lexus LC with the updated infotainment system this is definitely the best in the business unless you really need the performance and brand name of a pora 911 [Applause] [Music]"

      "subtitles": "this is the new 2025 Toyota crown signia and it&#39;s an SUV or at least that&#39;s what Toyota says I think it looks like a wagon but they call it a crossover which makes this Toyota&#39;s 9th SUV it&#39;s replacing the Venza and it&#39;s supposed to fit in between the Rav 4 and the Highlander in size but it&#39;s more expensive than the Highlander even though it has less seats if you aren&#39;t confused yet well great today I&#39;m going to review the crown signia and show you all of its quirks and [Applause] features today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern Enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has sold almost $500 million worth of cars all sorts of special and cool stuff like this and this and this and this if you&#39;re looking to sell your Enthusiast car reach a vast audience at carsand bids.com all right time for the quirks and features of the Toyota Crown signia starting with undoubtedly its biggest Quirk which is what is this and how does it fit into Toyota&#39;s lineup so Toyota say says this is a two row crossover SUV and it&#39;s replacing the Venza which is ending production later this year this goes on sale sometime this summer however I take issue with some of Toyota&#39;s statements here let&#39;s start with the crossover SUV component I got out my trusty cars and bids tape measure and found that this is about 63 and a half in high which makes it shorter in height than a Subaru Outback which is about 66 in high now one could easily make the argument that the Outback has gotten so much larger over the years it is no longer really a wagon but it&#39;s now kind of a crossover itself which could make this also a crossover but still if you think of the Outback as a wagon this is shorter in height now the crown signia is taller than my Mercedes E-Class station wagon which is undoubtedly a wagon at 59 in in height but we&#39;re only talking about a few inches difference between all these cars and none of them are really approaching tall SUV crossover height so to me this feels a little bit more wagon than SUV now if you agree with Toyota and call this a crossover it means that they now have nine different Crossovers and SUVs I&#39;m going to try to name them the bz 4X the Corolla cross the Rav 4 the Highlander the grand Highlander that&#39;s five the 4Runner the Land Cruiser this and the seoa nine different different SUVs which means that each segment is chopped pretty thin and it doesn&#39;t leave a whole lot of space for a new one this and that&#39;s specifically true when you consider exactly what space it&#39;s occupying so check this out Toyota is cancelling the Venza for the second time they&#39;ve had an original Venza it was cancelled years later came out with a second Venza it was also cancelled the reason it didn&#39;t sell all that well now the Venza was a two row crossover just like the Rav 4 but it was more expensive consumers didn&#39;t really seem to want that so the Venza is gone the problem is the Venza started around $36,000 this replacing the Venza starts around $45,000 so it&#39;s more expensive than the vehicle that was just cancelled due to poor sales and in fact the $45,000 starting price of the crown signia makes it more expensive than a regular Toyota Highlander which offers more power more size and three row seating compared to the two row seating in the crown signia now I will admit readily that the crown signia is a lot nicer inside than a Highlander especially a Highlander that you can get in its price range the 45 to 50 low $50,000 Highlander this is definitely nicer and that is a key to this vehicle&#39;s positioning but I still kind of question the theory that someone&#39;s going to want a two row crossover like a RAV four but at a cost that&#39;s like a kind of mid or hi trim Highlander it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s really that many people who are going to be interested in that again considering it&#39;s got less practicality than the Highlander and less power in performance now with that said for some people the crown signos powertrain will actually be an asset even though it&#39;s got less power than a Highlander and that&#39;s because this comes standard with a hybrid powertrain that gets fantastic mileage it&#39;s a 2.5 5 L hybrid 4 cylinder it maxes out at only 240 horsepower that&#39;s not a huge number especially for a midsize crossover wagy thing and the result is 0 to 60 in just over 7 Seconds not tremendously fast it&#39;s not so slow that it&#39;s going to be dangerous but it&#39;s not exactly high performance however the benefit is you get 38 m per gallon in Combined City and highway driving and that&#39;s with all-wheel drive which comes standard on the crown signia so almost 40 m per gallon the tradeoff is some performance and power but really great fuel economy and still all- weather security of all-wheel drive but anyway on to the crks and features of the crown signia Beyond just the crown signia itself we begin with the key which is not just a regular Toyota key this is the key to my Sequoia it&#39;s a boring regular key because I&#39;ve bought a boring regular to Toyota but the crown gets this key that says Toyota Crown in this special area on the back that makes you feel more luxurious than a standard Toyota buyer but before we climb inside let&#39;s talk exterior quirks starting with the frontend styling which is a little unorthodox you come up here there&#39;s a lot going on so this thin light strip positioned where the headlight usually is is not the headlight it&#39;s the L running light and it becomes the turn signal when you put on the turn signal the headlight is actually here in this position which kind of seems like where a fog light should be but no that&#39;s the headlight now if you go above both of these things you have this which is just a hole so you have the headlight in a weird spot the running light in a weird spot and then a hole now if you move to the center you have the grill which is also a little bit odd it&#39;s sort of got a bunch of openings and then it fades into fewer openings basically none and that&#39;s your grill situation aside from the kind of weird front end in this car though I have to say I really like how the crown signia looks I am a fan of wagons I really kind of think this is one and I think they&#39;ve done a great job making it look nice which is impressive because the crown sedan is kind of a heinous car it is really not a particularly attractive vehicle wheels are too big the windows are too small small the whole profile is odd the front end is weird they&#39;ve done a much better job with the signia adding on the rear end making it premium luxurious it looks nice good very welld designed I think this is a surprisingly attractive vehicle and that&#39;s also true inside the attractiveness of the crown signia definitely carries over to the interior where you have well a surprisingly nice one it&#39;s well laid out it&#39;s beautiful really an attractive space in here it&#39;s almost knocking on the door of Lexus quality despite not having a Lexus brand name by the way that&#39;s another competitor for this car the Lexus NX and RX are not tremendously more expensive either which is also in the Toyota portfolio but if for some reason you want a nice Toyota without the Lexus brand name this car clearly delivers on the inside you can also see the seats are very attractive the upper part is this nice stitching and cool design and there is a very minimal use of cheap plastic even on the dashboard basically everything you can see feel and touch is some high quality material it all looks and feels surprisingly nice inside the crown signia and that gives it some advantage over other models in the Toyota lineup even at its high price tag now on the inside of the crown signia there are some interesting quirks and features worth pointing out one that I absolutely love is the rear view mirror camera you can see right now the rear viiew mirror is a rear viw mirror but if you flip this switch it becomes a camera and you can see behind you a lot easier you don&#39;t have to look through the entire vehicle it&#39;s a fantastic feature so glad Toyota is implementing it on so many cars I wish other manufacturers would follow suit now you also have a center console here that&#39;s not surprising but the cool part is it opens from driver or passenger side you got a button on one side you can open it you flip it the other way you got a button on the passenger side I don&#39;t know how they do it it&#39;s magic but they do and it&#39;s wonderful they hand another interesting quirk of the crown signia is the wireless cell phone charger a lot of cars have them this one has it placed pretty well it&#39;s located here in the center console and it&#39;s completely vertical not flat like in some cars takes up a lot of space here the space is minimal and it&#39;s hard to show it on camera but there&#39;s even little clips that hold your phone in place inside this little hole to make sure it stays charging even if you go over bumps or around corners which is a neat idea also how&#39;s this for an interesting Quirk and the crown signia you can of course turn on your heated seats your cooled seats and your heated steering wheel or you can let the car decide for you you&#39;ve heard of automatic climate control where you select a temperature and then the car makes that temperature happen inside well here you can select automatic heated and cooled seats and steering wheel and the car will turn them on or off depending on the temperature so you don&#39;t have to press anything you get inside and it&#39;s cold your heated seat will be automatically on if you want same with the steering wheel of course you can still manually turn them on but Auto heated seats and cooled seats is a pretty cool feature and on the subject of heating things this car has a heated windshield the button is over here to the left of the steering wheel you push it and it turns on the heated windshield now unlike some really high-end off- rotors it isn&#39;t the whole windshield that gets heated but just an element around the edges of the windshield will heat it regardless this is a great feature to have because it can heat up the ice that&#39;s binding your wind Shield wipers to the windshield on a very cold day and make it easier for you to drive off and other ice to melt off the windshield that&#39;s nice to have one other interesting item in here you have paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel upshift and downshift this is a feature that in the crown signia will never ever be used and next up another interesting button to the left of the steering wheel this button here is for the headlight washers if you press that little Jets shoot out from right above the headlights in order to clean them and you can do it whenever you want you feel like your headlights are a little dirty or Dusty maybe from being mounted so low just push the button and then they&#39;re clean and you don&#39;t have to do it yourself like some plean and next up we move on to the technology in this car which is actually pretty decent I already mentioned the mirror camera which I like but then we have the center infotainment screen Toyota&#39;s infotainment technology is pretty good this screen is actually relative ATIV L small but it still works reasonably well fairly intuitive very responsive nice and easy to use and of course Apple carplay and Android auto come standard one drawback of this infotainment system is that you can&#39;t have two panels showing at once so you can&#39;t have your navigation and your music at the same time but that&#39;s not really that huge of a deal easy to switch between them I will say another drawback is the absolutely ridiculous surround view camera system you press this view button and it turns on and then just sort of shows this egg-shaped camera image around the car you can&#39;t twist it or move it like in every other car with one of these cameras you just have to kind of wait for it to show the spot you want to see it&#39;s absurd however I will say one thing I love that I&#39;ve learned from owning my Sequoia if you&#39;re in drive and you press that same camera view button it pops up the full regular camera system in this car which is a pretty good system and it shows more angles and better high quality images this is especially nice because the camera only comes on if you&#39;re in Reverse but in case you&#39;re pulling into some tight area and you haven&#39;t shifted into reverse but you still want to see the cameras you get an easy way to do that by just pressing the view Button as long as you&#39;re in drw now as for the gauge cluster in the crown signia I got to say I really like it I&#39;m very impressed with it which is a surprise because previous Toyota digital gauge clusters I have really not loved including the one in my seoa which I would say is only okay that&#39;s a 24 model this a 25 and they&#39;ve updated it well to add more configurability you can now configure all three panels in this digital gauge cluster so on the left you can have your audio what&#39;s playing in the center you can have a map on the right you can have your current trip details odometer Etc or you can mix it up and show various other things on all of those screens they&#39;re all configurable and they let you basically see whatever it is that you might want it&#39;s hard to imagine wanting even more and you can even focus this screen more if you want you can get rid of the digital gauges the circle components and have your info displayed in an even larger size on all three of these panels it&#39;s a great digital gauge cluster we&#39;ve been waiting for a good one from Toyota and this is the first new Toyota I&#39;ve seen with a really good system for the gauge cluster also another cool thing in the gauge cluster one of the displays actually gives you an Eco score when you&#39;re driving along it&#39;ll rate how eco-friendly you&#39;re driving how fuele efficient you&#39;re driving and so you can measure that against previous drives and see just how economically you&#39;re driving the car which is kind of cool and next up we move on to the back seat in the crown signia and I got to say the sizing is pretty good even though this has kind of a lower roof line compared to a lot of Crossovers and SUVs and it&#39;s not intended for maximizing passenger carrying capability with a third row and back there&#39;s decent space here I have the front seat positioned where I would sit as a pretty tall driver and I&#39;m sitting back here my knees still have several inches before they would hit the back of the front seat I have Headroom even though we have a big panoramic sunroof here which sometimes steals Headroom especially in a lower car it&#39;s just a lot of space knees head hips it all works out back here and it&#39;s a comfortable place to be and there are some nice amenities in the back as well you got rear heated seats you can turn them on in this button on the door panel as you can see you got rear climate vents back here which is also nice and rear USB C ports for plugging in and charging your devices and of course you got rear cup holders back here as well there&#39;s some integrated into the door panel on each side if you want or you can fold down this Center armrest and find more cup holders so nothing particularly exciting or cool or quirky or feury back here but a nice comfortable place to spend time and finally we move on to the cargo area in the crown signia you open up in the power tailgate and you discover a cargo area nothing particularly exciting back here although it is deep ER I longer than I expected it to be so there&#39;s decent space back here again despite the fact that this isn&#39;t some huge Mondo SUV it&#39;s got pretty good cargo sizing I will say the roof height probably does play some role in here of limiting cargo space a bit if you wanted to totally maximize and jam it packed a taller crossover would have a little bit more space but I think it does the job for most people most of the time now one interesting thing back here under the floor you don&#39;t really have any extra storage like you do in some cars but if you lift up the floor it&#39;s hinged after a few inches where there is a small little extra storage compartment where you can put small little extra items if you want to just a little bit of stuff can go back there you can lift up the floor the rest of the way but you can see there&#39;s stuff back there there&#39;s not really space where you can put any extra storage items except in that little compartment right at the front which frankly is better than nothing now also worth pointing out that back in the cargo area you have these pches you can use to drop the rear seats not power operated but that&#39;s fine and that means if you&#39;re coming up to the car with a large item you don&#39;t have to go around to each individual back seat to drop it you can just do it from the cargo area which adds some convenience of course if you want to put the seats back up you do have to do that individually at the seats themselves but it&#39;s still better than nothing in the cargo area of the crown signia all right driving the Toyota Crown signia the most aggressively anyone has ever described this vehicle um in the car World station wagon is a dirty word you don&#39;t want to say station wagon nobody wants a station wagon everybody wants a crossover you can&#39;t say station wagon even if you are offering a station wagon unless you were Subaru and then you just say Outback and then everybody gets it and they&#39;re happy this car is nice looking it&#39;s going to occupy an obscure portion of Toyota&#39;s lineup it will sell in small numbers but it drives really nicely it looks really good I think from the outside um the interior is just gorgeous in here it&#39;s priced way too high it&#39;s it&#39;s in a very thinly sliced segment I don&#39;t know why anyone would really buy this car over the Highlander to be honest and Toyota&#39;s like well it&#39;s for empty nesters they want better mileage they don&#39;t need the seats yeah but if you give someone the opportunity to have more seats for less money they&#39;re going to take it CU that H maybe we&#39;ll need it I&#39;m not sure honey don&#39;t you think yeah I would probably yeah you should just get the seats save some money like no one is going to buy this but for the few people who do they&#39;re going to be treated to actually a pretty nice experience this car is almost at the level of Lexus quality and honestly the other thing that&#39;s kind of cool about it is it&#39;s going to be a little bit more you know special and and interesting compared to a boring standard Highlander or rev 4 hybrid or whatever like those cars are everywhere there&#39;s literally one right in front of me as I&#39;m saying this now to me the biggest drawback of this car I should point out the um pricing is just is too high I mean the Venza was already not popular and it was like eight grand cheaper than this so I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find a huge I don&#39;t think the strategy is take the price and make it even higher I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s necessarily going to do it but let&#39;s talk Driving Experience a little bit uh more specifically this dri is great it&#39;s very smooth nice and comfortable um good amount of interior room in here knee room head room leg room hip room it all feels nice now it isn&#39;t fast at all I mean it really is not a fast vehicle it&#39;s it&#39;s fine it&#39;s totally adequate gets you around town gets you on the freeway no problem but but you will never win any drag races in this car but I think that&#39;s totally okay again car enthusiasts are going to be like that&#39;s slow and it is by car Enthusiast standards but for for grandparents from Calgary who want to come down uh to Palm Springs in the winter this is a great option for them great highway fuel economy and when they&#39;re back in Calgary they can still have a car to drive around their grandkids although I suspect they&#39;d rather have the seats in the Highlander it is worth out though that this car is a lot nicer than the Highlander and the reason it&#39;s more expensive is because you can get a cheaper Highlander than this but it&#39;s kind of an average lower trim Highlander this is a nice car at this price point it really is like a legitimately nice high-end car with a nice interior you&#39;re just making the trade off of seats but you&#39;re getting the great benefit of fantastic fuel economy this is still a desirable vehicle if for whatever reason it does fit into your space you want something nicer than a Rav 4 you don&#39;t need the seats on a Highlander this is that I just think that&#39;s a very thin slice of the pot population um but I also think the result of that is this car will probably be a pretty good deal on the used Market in a few years uh and maybe that&#39;s the best way to buy the crown Insignia especially if you a wagon Enthusiast you get a secret hidden Toyota wagon just make sure to call it a crossover if you ever meet any Toyota people and so that&#39;s the new 2025 Toyota Crown signia frankly I&#39;m not sure that this is something it&#39;s nice it drives reasonably well it looks good it gets great mileage it has a fantastic interior but I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s really going to buy this I like that it&#39;s sort of Toyota coming back with a wagon but they&#39;re selling it as a crossover and they already have eight others that you can choose from and they&#39;ve already cancelled the Venza twice in this segment so I&#39;m not really sure if this will actually do any better but I guess we&#39;ll find out and now it&#39;s time to give the crown signia a Doug score and the Doug score is here 47 out of 100 which places the crown signia here against some relevant cars I like the crown signia in Principle as it&#39;s effectively a Toyota wagon even though they call it a crossover but in practice it leaves me confused it replaces the slow selling Venza but it&#39;s even more expensive which I suspect will lead to even slower sales it&#39;s also more expensive than hybrid versions of the Toyota Rav 4 which offer better gas mileage and similar practicality though not the same level of luxury for luxury however you can upgrade to a Lexus NX or RX for not much more money and still keep the hybrid powertrain just with a better brand name and a nicer interior the crown signia is a legitimately nice car but it doesn&#39;t really fit in and I&#39;d probably buy one of the other options [Applause] [Music] first e"

      "subtitles": "this is Doug deuro and today we&#39;re going to talk about undervalued sports cars and what I mean by this is sports cars that are awesome or excellent or fantastic or better than their current market price suggest they should be I&#39;m not talking about cars that I think are going to shoot up in value in the future because they&#39;re underappreciated by the modern car Enthusiast I mean cars I that aren&#39;t necessarily going to become more valuable but just for the price you pay it seems to be undervalued for the experience that these cars deliver uh I haven&#39;t got this list ranked I&#39;m going to just do it alphabetically but these are the sports cars that I think are undervalued that are better than what they cost let&#39;s do [Applause] it today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has sold almost $500 million worth of cars all sorts of special interesting stuff like this and this and this and this so if you&#39;re looking to buy or sell a cool Enthusiast car do it at carsand bids.com okay starting my list of undervalued sports cars again this isn&#39;t ranked it&#39;s actually alphabetical and so I&#39;m I&#39;m going to start with the Aston Martin V8 Vantage and the DB9 the used V8 Vantage and DB9 and particularly early models from the kind of mid to late 2000s I put both of these together on this list because they actually cost about the same you can kind of have your pick between a V8 Vantage or a DB9 for around the $40,000 Mark high 30s to 40 to low to mid-40s will get you into a pretty nice V8 Vantage or DB9 I got to say that&#39;s a pretty good deal when you consider what these cars are in the case of the DB9 you get a V12 an absolutely beautiful luxury Cruiser a great sound a gorgeous car in the case of the Vantage for the same money you also get a gorgeous car a little bit less beauty and a little bit more sporty performan e tossable kind of fun Driving Experience kind of thing the Vantage is more common to find with a manual transmission the DB9 is more common automatic it&#39;s sort of a pick your poison do you want the V12 Luxury Grand Tour or the V8 kind of more sporty tossable car either way you can get them around 40 Grand and although I wouldn&#39;t normally list these vehicles as you know undervalued considering yeah they&#39;re cheap but they&#39;re unreliable the truth is that when you look on cars and bids we get these submitted to us pretty commonly with 70 80 90,000 miles on them they seem to be Fairly reliable and I know this firsthand because I owned an 06 V8 Vantage which was second first or second model year and it was pretty good I bought the car after it been sitting for a while not really being used and it had some problems at the start but then I drove it uh to 34 US states across the country and back and it was totally fine very reliable really a solid car quite an impressive vehicle actually and I got to say that&#39;s kind of been the experience of other people I know who have had these cars it&#39;s actually kind of a perfect vehicle because Aston Martin&#39;s reputation for reliability has absolutely tanked their resale value but the actual lived experience of owning these cars is a lot better than the $40,000 price tag would suggest they&#39;re beautiful gorgeous incredible to look at and not really all that expensive to buy or own it&#39;s not going to be a Toyota but it&#39;s also not as bad as you might think okay next sports car that I think is surprisingly undervalued how about the original out RS5 this is a great one the original RS5 was sold 2013 to 2015 is and it came with a 450 horsepower big old naturally aspirated V8 you can&#39;t get one of these with a manual transmission but they are beautiful cars styled by Walter D Silva an Italian who created one of some of the most beautiful cars and this was kind of his ultimate Beauty uh the RS the A5 and S5 are generally attractive but the RS5 was especially gorgeous it was also wonderfully subtle The Styling was just beautiful they didn&#39;t rely on all sorts of ugly things to make it seem cooler than it was they just went with the design big a little bigger Wheels some subtle upgrades here or there and then that 450 horse na8 under the hood and the real key is that you can pick one of these up for around $25,000 right now and that&#39;s a pretty good deal for a low production only made it for 3 years rare special car that certainly didn&#39;t continue in production in this form you know the next RS5 had a turbo V6 it was technically faster whatever but the original one with a big old V8 that&#39;s the cool one short production run beautiful car and surprisingly inexpensive and that leads me to my very next undervalued sports car which is the Audi ttrs and specifically the original ttrs that was sold in the states uh which was like 2013 145 also about that same ERA this car has a turbo 5-cylinder with 360 horsepower that is a big number for a car the size of an Audi TT uh short production run very rare car they were manual transmissions and it&#39;s an Audi RS car you know a lot of enthusiasts like to knock the Audi TT oh it&#39;s it&#39;s small and it&#39;s got the soft curvy styling it&#39;s not an aggressive sports car well this one had 360 horsepower Turbo 5 cylinder manual transmission uh this thing wet and it was really rare and really special and these days you can easily pick one up in the low $30,000 range and this car will absolutely hang with BMW z4m Coupe type Vehicles it was a very special very desirable very rare car and frankly a pretty beautiful one as well if you get past the oh it&#39;s a TT stereotypes and really look at what the TTR RS specifically is it was a very special car and I think that it&#39;s undervalued considering the experience you get the fun the speed the performance and the Rarity you&#39;re very rarely going to encounter another one on the road or at Cars and Coffee or anybody else who has one it really is a special car next one on my list of undervalued sports cars at least for the experience that you get the e82 BMW 1 Series so this was the original BMW 1 series sold from like the late 2000s up to 2015 or something like that I think that BMW has a fantastic history of making high performance little cars and even though there&#39;s been a lot of complaints that over the years BMW vehicles have grown larger and larger which is true you know the three series is now the size of the old Five series etc etc you hear those complaints BMW still stays true to their tradition of making good little cars every so often and so obviously the most famous one is the 2002 from the 1970s but then you had the e33 series in the late 80s and early 90s and I think in the 2000s they kind of brought it all back with the e821 series in the States this was only sold as a coupe or a convertible which really helped to drive home the point of the sportiness in other markets it was sold as a hatchback and with some smaller powertrains and really meant to be more of a practical car but here it was all about performance and excitement and it&#39;s a fun car it is a really thrilling car to drive in the spirit of the original old school little tossable BMWs like the 2002 and the e33 series you can pick up an e82 an early BMW e821 specifically a 135 the most powerful version that they made short of the M car you can pick up a 135 for 9 to 11,000 this is going to be an automatic with high miles but you get the point that I&#39;m making if you spend $1 or $15,000 you can get a car that&#39;s been sorted with good miles a manual transmission and really have fun and everybody talks about how e303 series models are basically impossible to come by anymore it cheap they used to be so full then people turn them into track cars or they crash them or they get destroyed or whatever and that doesn&#39;t exist anymore well I would submit that it does exist in the case of the e82 the one series is that next level of that car and it&#39;s getting down to that price point when you start talking about the 9 to $111,000 range you account for inflation and that&#39;s where e30s used to be when people were so nostalgic about finding them on Craigslist for six grand this is the e82 now I want to be clear the e82 is going to have some problems especially the 135 that motor was known to have some issues uh but that&#39;s kind of like used BMW ownership and it certainly was the case of with e30s in some ways uh and it&#39;s certainly the case of other BMWs and you just kind of go into it knowing that so you&#39;re paying the 10 to 12,000 to buy the car and you know you&#39;re going to have to do some stuff this is a car for DIY people it&#39;s a car for people who kind of want to Tinker and maybe improve performance when something breaks or when a known failure point will break but it&#39;s still a pretty good bargain car and lives up to kind of this special BMW ethos and it drives really well for $113,000 it&#39;s tossable it&#39;s fun it&#39;s fast I really enjoy the e82 okay next up on my list of undervalued performance cars this is an obvious one I talk about it all the time the C5 Chevy Corvette Z06 now before I go any further I want to point out this is true of basically any C5 Chevy Corvette and it&#39;s also true of the C5 and C6 Z6 which are both Total Bargains but when you do the VIN diagram here the the the overlap is the C5 Corvette a bargain and the Z6 C5 or C6 combine them together the C5 Z6 specifically is the bargain for those who don&#39;t know the C5 Z6 was the high performance kind of track focused version of the C5 Corvette which had come out in &#39;98 the Z6 came out a few years later and it was a special car it used its kind of its own body style that wasn&#39;t really offered on the regular Corvette it was like a true Coupee and so it has a very special look to it um with some other special upgrades like distinctive wheels and some you know inlets on the side that they were subtle but that if you knew you knew but it wasn&#39;t just that it got an improved powertrain it got a naturally aspirated V8 a little over 400 horsepower which is a big number for a car the size of the C5 and then there were all these other little subtle and sharp tweaks to improve the cornering capabilities the handling performance of this car and it really was an excellent and surprisingly good and strong track car um for steering handling it&#39;s not what you associate with &#39;90s Corvettes or &#39; 80s or 70s or 60s Corvettes but this particular car that kind of was born from the C5 of the 9s really was a fun and enjoyable car to throw around because of the upgrades that they made to it um these days $20,000 will buy you a nice C5 Z6 you can buy ratty ones in the teens and you can buy really nice ones for like 30 like super low mileage well preserved Commemorative Edition but 20 grand will buy you a decent car with like a couple of M maybe a minor accident and reasonable miles you know 50,000 miles and that&#39;s a car you can really have a great time with and the fun part is you can drive it you can enjoy it you can throw it around and and kind of track it yourself and then you can sell it for pretty much what you paid because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been going for for a long time so it&#39;s an experience you can really enjoy and not really put all that much money into um they&#39;re reliable they&#39;re good they&#39;re fun to drive and I really like that car okay next one this is an obvious one another one I&#39;ve been talking about for a long time and various videos similar to this the original Dodge Viper rt10 so that was the very first Viper that was sold from &#39;92 to 9596 the original vipers were sold with those famous three-spoke Wheels no real Windows no real roof um it was a very raw Automotive experience and you can pick one up these days for maybe $35 to $50,000 for a nice one which you might think sounds like a lot of money for a used Dodge but manual transmission naturally aspirated V10 and most importantly a true exotic car experience like when I I had the second gen Viper which cost a little bit more but when I would go and drive that thing around people would just freak out they would get so excited to see a Viper especially an old Viper on the road and it it&#39;s not unlike when I drive around my like crazy exotic cars these days I got a Lamborghini Countach that that gets more attention but not not 10 times more considering the value is 10 times higher these These Old vipers are really special EX cars and even beyond the attention they&#39;re just fun they&#39;re big engines mounted to a chassis and then there was some Bodywork thrown on top and they&#39;re very raw cars they&#39;re cars where you need a garage because they don&#39;t they they leak on the inside because they don&#39;t really have a roof and windows um they kind of have temporary solutions for that stuff they they&#39;re not the most usable cars which is why I think that values haven&#39;t really taken off I think people look at them and say you know that&#39;s cool but unless you live in Southern California or Arizona in the spring and fall places where it&#39;s dry and warm you&#39;re not really going to be able to use the car and so I don&#39;t see the Viper shooting up in value but I do see the experience being undervalued considering what it offers it is just so cool and so exciting and so much fun okay next up in terms of undervalued sports cars cars that offer more than their price tag would suggest next one maybe this is too easy or obvious but the ND Mazda Miata I&#39;ve never been a massive Miata guy there some people who are really obset with them I&#39;m more of a generalist I like the na and the NB and the NC just fine but for me the ND which is the current most recent Mazda Miata came out 10 years ago now back in 2015 that is just the most exciting and enjoyable and wondrous car I love how the ND Miata looks I love how it drives I love how it feels I love how it handles and I love that they were able to bring back the spirit of like the original Little kind of lightweight Miata while still including modern features that you would expect and wrapping it in this absolutely gorgeous package it is not the fastest car in the world and in order to make it a really excellent great experience you kind of have to get a later one they got more power they added a folding hard top which I think makes it look better and more usable but then you start to lose the value proposition the early ND Miatas which came out for the 16 model year um you can get a cheap one for around $15,000 and around 20 will get you a really decent one with a manual transmission and low mileage and a lot of fun and I don&#39;t want to say that&#39;s a lot of car for the money because it&#39;s not in terms of horsepower and performance but it is a really nice experience for that price point and again a very slow depreciation curve they did not make a ton of ND Mias you know interest in that segment has not been as strong as it was when the Miata first came out 30 years ago um and so it&#39;s been a little bit rarer to find especially a manual well equipped not over modified not crashed and for 20 grand that gets you a nice one you probably own that five or six years and sell it for not too much less than that and really get a nice experience out of it now again you&#39;re not going to have the experience of throwing it around and really flooring it and getting great power out accelerating everybody from a stoplight but you will have a really great steering and handling experience in a really nice looking car and you can look at yourself and say you know for 20 grand this gives me a lot of the Thrills that people get in exotic cars that cost way more just sort of without the ego component right nobody&#39;s ever going to look at an ND and say whoa man that&#39;s a cool car but you can have the same experience and frankly I think that&#39;s that&#39;s just as enjoyable for a lot of people it&#39;s really a nice car it&#39;s really a lot of fun to own to drive to exist with and I really love the ND okay next up on my list of undervalued sports cars for the experience they provide this one is obvious and it doesn&#39;t get discussed enough but the Nissan 350Z the one that came out back at 0 3 is a really really undervalued car considering all that it offers um the 03z came out with about 300 horsepower initially it was just shy and later it was boosted to right about 300 horsepower um they are easy to find there&#39;s a lot of them around they&#39;re easy to find manual transmissions a lot of them were made um it has a very reliable powertrain that is very easy to own to operate to tune to modify and to find parts for that VQ V6 engine and you could find one pretty easily for around $110,000 and that is just a total bargain especially when you consider that the previous model the z32 which was sold from like the early 90s 96 97 um nice versions of that car are big money $4 $50,000 for really well-kept nice ones the 350Z has never really earned that classic car status where values start to rise and it starts to appreciate and so it never really got expensive or valuable um and there are still even nice ones to this day are not really that much more than around $10,000 for a fun tossable powerful this is actually a car that even by today&#39;s standard still feels fast and exciting and Powerful um reliable sports car and I think it looks cool and I think it still kind of turns heads and I think someday you will see some of that value appreciation and excitement for these cars especially nice ones kept in good shape but right now enjoy the bargain while you can it really is a surprisingly good deal and finally my last undervalued sports car that delivers more than it should for the price this is an obvious one been talking about this for years the 996 Porsche 911 the Porsche 911 that was sold from 1999 to 2005 give or take um these are really fun cars it&#39;s it&#39;s your ability to get into a Porsche 911 without spending 80 90 $100,000 like so many older 911s now cost um those old 911s are are kind of gone from a lot of enthusiasts who want the Porsche experience and so the question is well how can I get into a 911 you know every Enthusiast kind of asked themselves that question at one point and the answer is a 996 which is still a very affordable car early automatic transmission 996 911s are in the low teens 1334 15 $15,000 but even if you want a manual round 20 buys you a cheap manual 996 911 and 30 $30,000 buys you a really nice one like a good it&#39;ll be a two- wheel drive narrow body car car mov some miles but like no bad Carfax later model not modified like a nice good 996 $30,000 of will buy that for you and that&#39;s a pretty good number to get into a 911 when you look at the fact that earlier cars even regular ones are in the $ 60 $70,000 range that&#39;s getting out of reach for a lot of enthusiasts if you&#39;ve ever wanted to scratch that 911 inch yeah it&#39;s just the 996 but it still drives fantastically it&#39;s still a wonderful car to own and operate and use you know the 911 that came before the 996 was the 993 which everybody is so obsessed with such a special car and it really is but the 996 was the successor the later version for a reason it was more powerful it was just as enjoyable to drive it&#39;s really a very very exciting car it just doesn&#39;t look as good it wasn&#39;t as reliable and they made far more and so production numbers have made it less rare and a little bit less special in terms of buying it but I think a really nice 996 and especially one that&#39;s been well sorted with the Ms issue taken care of is a really good bargain even still today and I think that&#39;s especially true when you look at what&#39;s happened to older 911 values and you start to wonder if that market is is going to completely slip away from you if you want to make a purchase and just take a bite out of the 911 world having a 996 is a special way to do it regardless of what Porsche purists tell you they&#39;ll complain about the water cooled the interior quality the look of the headlights it&#39;s all stupid when you&#39;re behind the wheel it is a fun enjoyable tossable fast exciting car to drive with great driver inputs pedal steering brake it&#39;s just a great car and um they had a little bit of a moment right after Co that the prices started to rise and I started to think hey this is it the 996 is finally going to start to become a really valuable car the enthusiasts the collectors are starting to latch on and then it kind of dropped off the the balloon deflated and 996 values came right back down and they&#39;re still affordable and I&#39;m not sure how much longer that&#39;s going to last as more of these get modified as more engines blow up um a lot of automatics out there a lot of people doing Safari builds like it&#39;s going to become harder and harder to find a nice 996 in the future and so if you want to do it at some point soon get into a 911 this is your chance to do it without spending crazy money so those are my undervalued sports cars again I don&#39;t necessarily think all of these are going to shoot up in value over the years but I do think all of them give more of an experience than you would expect considering what they cost all of these cars are special fun and exciting and surprisingly affordable uh considering how enjoyable they are at various different price points I really like all of the cars on this list some more maintenance intensive than others but all of them are a really good bargain for what they deliver to the car enthusiast [Applause] [Music]"

      "subtitles": "[Music] hello and welcome to this carp I&#39;m Kenan I&#39;m filipo and today we&#39;re going to talk about cars now this week Kenan is out of town and so we&#39;ve pre-recorded this episode and so we have no news to discuss so we&#39;re just going to get right into talking about cars starting with some interesting filipo related content go ahead yeah I have a 2014 Mercedes-Benz E 350 formatic wagon we found that out last $85,000 MSRP fun fact in 2014 real M he&#39;s bragging about his Originals no but but Nick who sometimes on the podcast and I have compared window stickers because he has a heavily depreciated Cen from the same year his cost more originally um but my sticker less I think My5 was $75,000 your translation with reder on mine yours is less mine is less and I got a 23 and my Sequoia was less driving around a rich guy car I got all these I my my spec is excellent it is that car has everything um yeah and a lot of it&#39;s breaking right now correct yeah the the car is 10 years old it has 110,000 miles I bought it on cars and bids with 65,000 something like that no way you&#39;ve put 50,000 miles on that car you bought it like two years ago 45 if you want to do the math correctly but yeah red around there there she is um there she is indeed bought it from a nice gentlem the car he bought the car in Maine and he he&#39;s cumulatively driven it from Maine to San Diego correct what fun fact I bought it in Maine drove flew up there drove back in June 3rd or something like that and then uh about 3 months later went back up to Maine to within 10 miles of this guys house with some friends um uh but it&#39;s great okay 65,000 when I bought it 1095 so that right now wow it&#39;s it&#39;s been excellent it&#39;s been like legitimately trouble-free till like six months go and now things just kind of small issues arise one big issue with break lines and rust uh that only impacted the break lines incredibly uh but then like there are small things like the there&#39;s a rear air suspension as in all these s12s and that&#39;s making noises now there&#39;s a bunch of other like kind of small things that are just starting to wear which makes sense what its age and mileage but I&#39;m getting annoyed by it like just getting annoying that that these things arise that I have to fix that that I like we&#39;re busy I don&#39;t want to take time to bring it up to the shop whatever so I&#39;m starting to think about what would I replace it with filipo will you please just do what I have begged you to do BU a an E-class wagon of your generation please it&#39;s the greatest car any of us have ever owned I I have just one rule in that&#39;s that I think my next nonperformance car needs to be a hybrid and ideally a plugin hybrid I have a it&#39;s a hybrid what are you talking about it&#39;s a hybrid it&#39;s a 48 volt BS hybrid the the fuel economy of yours is equivalent to the fuel economy of mine that does not work for me and no D I got 34 driving it to from California Massachusetts 34 you ever get 34 uh no but when I don&#39;t drive it it gets like 30-ish um when you don&#39;t drive oh I see no no my my my fipo the eass that came out in 17 is the single greatest car ever built your Your Wagon is over here I drove it here from your house that went through a car wash for you my entire thought the entire time was it&#39;s fine no that&#39;s the point that&#39;s what an E-class is supposed to be I already have that experience already have that that car I want a hybrid I want a plug in hybrid ideally no no so which plug in hybrid should I buy cuz I need a plug because we regularly Drive 500 miles at a time and an EV is not great for that especially because we&#39;re often my wife&#39;s family is Northern Arizona there&#39;s not a great charging infrastructure through the middle of the desert I but my wife also drives frequently 20 miles at a time and a plugin Hy would be perfect for that fipo please please get the new E-class fipo I&#39;m telling you that the E-class that came out in 17 the 213 E-class is the greatest car that has ever been made it is the best daily driver forget about it don&#39;t think about it be relaxed and comfortable I care about the environment and I want I got a hybrid it&#39;s a hybrid it says on F economy it&#39;s a 4il hybrid that doesn&#39;t add any fuel economy it&#39;s a hybrid it&#39;s the same way it&#39;s a hybrid that them that the Chevy Malu was for years because every sh most Chevy malus were 48 volt mild hybrid hybri here&#39;s a fact for you this is great the seoa is a also a mild hybrid no Z is an actual hybrid I can drive it in full electric if I if you the throttle like crazy and keep it under 12 you can drive it in full electric and so I&#39;ve been doing that and and so you&#39;re on a 25 Speed Street and you&#39;re going like 14 you know and you&#39;re an electric and people are like why aren&#39;t you going faster and it&#39;s like I&#39;m saving the environment you&#39;re getting passed by people walking but yeah yeah you are but I&#39;m getting I&#39;m getting infinite miles per gallon infinite miles per gallon which is the beauty of a hybrid can you do that in your wagon no you cannot no for some reason fle big like regular battery yeah I&#39;ll give you two suggestions number one the E-class wagon number two Ford Fusion Energy because it&#39;s the only plug-in hybrid I know but please get an E-class wagon please it&#39;s so good all right can I give you guys the actual options that I&#39;m vaguely considering sure yeah um vaguely considering lightly used X5 45 e which are plug-in hybrid BW X5 you would never buy that next they get first of all they depreciate so quickly second of all though their fuel economy when they&#39;re when like it&#39;s not on plugin hybrid is about 22 mes per gallon highway which is just too bad um xt90 T8 hybrid you would never buy it too big too expensive you would never do slightly older Porsche Cayenne hybrid those are 12,000 butun problem there is no way there was no way that gets better mileage than my e-class wagon there was no way but it&#39;s plugin hybrid so like when not no it isn&#39;t the the original Cayenne hybrid that came out in 11 was not a plug-in hybrid it was a it was a gas hybrid look it up what do you mean look it up I worked for the company the original cayen hybrid the one that was sold from 11 to 14 plugin hybrid system in the subtitle what year is that 17 that&#39;s not an original one and what did it sell for by the way it was bid to H25 these are free but they have the same problem wag which is it&#39;s it&#39;s a more heavily used car that&#39;s going to have the same problems so then then you get to okay my wife doesn&#39;t care about cars she won&#39;t really care it&#39;s we&#39;re usually taking on road trips where she&#39;s driving it should we just lease a newer regular car no and they answer it turns out that every midsize Crossover at the moment excluding like the raft 4 is available for about $300 a month as a lease deal and that gets appealing no well give me a better solution that&#39;s still plugin H give a better solution okay 300 bucks a month I&#39;m going to tell you what it is Ken pull up E450 wagons type in type in e e E-class and then just just look at 17s and up because it&#39;s too hard to figure out what they&#39;re called I think they&#39;re called we actually just sold a nice one for 31 they were e400 before by the way they had any e400 wagon we just sold a nice one for for oh God it what is this year stuff just type in e400 wagon go up there and type in that right click on that gray one click on that gray one that&#39;s sold for 315 right felipo you could buy this in instead of spending 300 a month on a lease for 36 months that&#39;s going to cost you 10 grand yeah this will not depreciate 10 grand yes it will because my car has I bought it for 27k I think it&#39;s worth about 20K now you put 50,000 miles on it in a year and a half and by the way if you it if you plan to do that for a leased car good life put 45,000 Mi on it across three and a half years which is right in line with normal leases no it&#39;s not Lees don&#39;t give you 16,000 miles a year they give you like 11 especially the kind of low low price leis is you&#39;re talking about 45,000 miles 3 and a half years is 12,800 fine I would could driven 800 fewer miles a year and been fine fipo please buy an E-class wagon it&#39;s the greatest car ever made even me I think this you guys wonder the real issue with buying this find one that has distronic find one that has any good options none of them do okay wait kenon go back a problem for me to be clear but GOP just type in eass 226 is a wild type in eass 25k okay was a total deal that one was a total deal it was in New Jersey you could have even gone you have your dream thing of driving it all the way across the country that total bargain I I I if I&#39;m replacing a car I need it to be a real hybrid um all right kenon let&#39;s move on to your talk I&#39;m not going to discuss hybrids with him he&#39;s being irrational and he&#39;s not he&#39;s not accepting the fact that it is a hybrid which it is and uh h it&#39;s yeah but the that that&#39;s like saying that I live in a mild house it&#39;s still a house well speaking of rational while Doug has an aneurysm we&#39;re gonna talk about something wrong about this you&#39;re not wrong you&#39;re not wrong you keep on about this but anyway so I was recently thinking a friend of mine when I were talking about like weird convertible cars and he reminded me of this company think it&#39;s called Newport convertible engineering now their job is they take normal cars sometimes there are convertible versions that exist sometimes there aren&#39;t and they turn them into convertibles but what was interesting to me is that they have a tab of their work on their website there goes there&#39;s custom convertibles classic convertibles and concept vehicles now I would like to give a couple examples of each to demonstrate what this company does because it&#39;s it&#39;s insane I I know what this is it&#39;s totally nuts so this one so we&#39;re on their uh right now so this is we start with some of their custom convertibles so 599 convertible version now of course that exists the essay of Pera but they did it in a different manner uh they took one and just completely led the roof off of it and by way look they did it in a better Manner and you want to know something about Newport we I when I worked at pors show we lost a day to this we someone found this website and and this was 10 years ago but the the pictures on there we lost a whole day like looking at these pictures Newport does a pretty damn good job they do well well we&#39;ll get to that oh yeah some of them are heinous but they do the best job they can but this 599 looks pretty good 599 looks pretty good uh but this one this was one of my favorites the myok uh llay convertible so a 62 or a 57 I can&#39;t tell yes and they turn and the way the convertible top sits is just on the trunk I&#39;m familiar with that that&#39;s how my Fiat works it is like your Fiat yes but I love the integr I just love how it looks so they done mle what do you want them to do it correctly that is yeah that but it a Tano cover too look at this mass of leather to cover up that that Ma to be fair although that is absurd I&#39;m quite certain that the actual Maybach laay which was a production car was the same way I think that the just means that yeah I think I think that just sat there on the back maybe not great um but then here here&#39;s one for you Doug no no go to the well we no pull this up I love this the G wagon convertibles that they&#39;ve made are so stupid because the problem with Newport convertible engineering and the problem making convertibles like this that people don&#39;t understand so when Rich guys in the Middle East commission these cars what they don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re not thinking about is four-door cars cannot easily be made to be convertibles because you have door frames and doors and rigidity so this G is the best example because when you try to make this g into a convertible if you got to leave that b pillar in for the doors to exist and then it looks absolutely heinous roof up or down this is not a Newport convertible engineering it&#39;s a four-door this is why if you ever wonder why there&#39;s no four-door convertibles it&#39;s because of this look how awful that looks he man that is a tough that&#39;s a tough looking vehicle but yeah it&#39;s EXA they did it they did it I mean they did it they did what the customer wanted to do which I I love but yeah but they there are just so many that are like this this Cayenne is another great example is one the alltime great have you ever seen have you ever seen the wood panel Cayenne no I&#39;ve seen photos of it I know what you&#39;re talking about but I have not seen it in person keep going keep going through these they&#39;re so good go go back to that Lexus LX oh yeah Lexus LX is again one of their so good brutal absolutely brutal it looks so silly it looks so bad do you have a picture with the roof on oh I&#39;m sure there must be I don&#39;t know yeah looks even worse and it&#39;s tan top too let me tell you though you&#39;re driving down Shake zad Road in Dubai and you have that and you look so much cooler than everybody else with their regular Alx that has a roof look at the a pillar how it just curves here it&#39;s like do they have any where they have to redo the tail lights because the tail lights were vertical oh yeah I can&#39;t imagine they they they must try hard to avoid that kind of stuff I would think so but I mean it just goes that is that a Range Rover Sport what is that is that a Range Rover Sport they made them into two doors look on that that&#39;s cool yeah so they do they do that with some frequency where they take a four-door and turn into a does the person that commissioned that know that the voke exists no so they did an 812 like like a it&#39;s like the was clearly before the GTS was announced but like it eventually ended up existing um but this is yeah but they want they wanted a cloth soft top not that BS this is that&#39;s one of the ugliest cars I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life by the way and I want it I want to be yeah yeah this 322 is really this twoo 320 322 that&#39;s incredible many years ago when I was in Pebble Beach many years ago I encountered a Newport convertible engineering l322 convertible Range Rover at Laguna sea they they actually had uh done it on a four-door and it was unbelievably heinous and of course I was very jealous yeah of course this this is a very aggressively ugly car but I want it everybody was looking at like 288 GTO evoluon and you were looking at the I love this also the the one with the top looks kind of like a I love with the windows up uh like a Rolls-Royce col and if you go it to the next photo no no no there there&#39;s some colon Vibes there that is so bad the funny thing about these cars the thing I&#39;ve always loved about the Newport convertible engineering cars the cost to build them is astronomical and the value that it adds is approximately $4 to the total cost that FJ Cruiser convertible I think that no there&#39;s a lot of FJ convertibles they&#39;re not this is like yeah I think the FJ convertible is probably their most popular thing that they do because we&#39;ve seen them around like in in new they&#39;re in Laguna Beach yeah people have them they&#39;re not that uncommon but so I had an observation that about their classic convertibles that they&#39;ve done the classics look like they should be that way like they kind of like track like this DB5 convertible looks like they did make a DB5 convertible didn&#39;t they I believe they I don&#39;t know if they didong to the DB5 but here&#39;s a idea maybe when they&#39;re making a classic convertible they just they take the coupe from the customer they go find a convertible version and they and then they just give it back to the customer and say hey look what we did I mean Rolls-Royce Kamar that was a heinous car convertible or coupe right true but I think the gem of all this is the Range Rover Classic that they did which is one of the roughest looking conversions I&#39;ve ever seen where&#39;s the top up picture this one oh also it certainly seems like they started with a four-door Range Rover but two door range Classics exist you know that um that would be better to I&#39;m sure someone wanted a nice one but it would be better to just buy a crappy one and just take the roof off and not have a cloth soft up and only drive it on nice days that&#39;s probably the better way to handle Baretta if you will Range Rover barquetta yeah I love the cars that are in the background here by the way y Newport veral engineering these people are gods and I love that they do this work I love any sort of coachbuilt or specialty made cars and I think this is so cool right one final point on them is their concept vehicles which I think are better than anything else so there are some of these that actually make sense so one like the Lamborghini Urus convertible I actually think that looks kind of I will these are all Concepts and they&#39;re clearly renderings and I wonder how they would actually make it work not how they would make it work they&#39; make it work but I think the winner of them all from everything we&#39;ve discussed so far is the Porsche paname convertible concept which is heinous this is uh an a first this is a facelifted first gen PanAm that we&#39;re looking at and boy if you have one I want to do this good luck to you but oh it&#39;s bad I kind of do want to do it I I it looks that I agree with you I don&#39;t think it looks that bad I think it&#39;s it&#39;s sool now I do wish that they had hired I don&#39;t know literally anybody with Photoshop skill to do this but FIP what what would this cost us do you think I mean we could we could buy one of these panir for like six right yeah 12 for a good one hey wait kenon I found an actual picture of one I&#39;m gonna text it to you you hold up your screen okay a picture of one it looks like it&#39;s got Saudi plates and uh this is what I want th this doesn&#39;t look bad I&#39;m actually into this now W walk to that camera and just or that camera hold it up waitting wait why don&#39;t I hold it up yeah that would have made so much sense he said it to our friend okay all right yeah why don&#39;t you just hold it up but yeah this is I don&#39;t have it on my phone oh no maybe I do because I S that is what it looks like can you thank you f there&#39;s so many and that is not working oh my God here here here look at that that&#39;s better thank you good I want that looks like a 928 convertible that they never made okay we&#39;ve gone way off the rails on convertible whatever that&#39;s what you do when you go to Newport so everybody I highly encourage you to go check out their website Newport convertible engineering or Newport convertible.car and oversized and and and embarrassing hard to find a parking lot I&#39;m embarrassed to own it I&#39;m embarrassed to drive it and it is great and uh my wife even likes it and we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we kind of all agree that it was the right choice but I&#39;ve been off-roading with it because I go Offroad I drive on the beach all the time H here and and it&#39;s been it&#39;s been hard this summer there&#39;s been a lot of uh soft sand people get stuck all the time the sequ is doing great it is the greatest off-roader that I&#39;ve ever had are you all concerned that it&#39;s the widest vehicle yeah it&#39;s big but we we ppf the size oh you ppf the sides no just to the G wagon actually I forgot but I don&#39;t care about the sides of does it do better than the G wagon yeah it&#39;s incredible you should see this thing you put it in sand mode and there&#39;s like 38 lines of defense and people were like you bought this big thing it&#39;s not going to Golf Road it&#39;s so bar good and it&#39;s like well actually no it it does a pretty good job and I&#39;m I&#39;m I really like it and I like when I&#39;m in it I feel powerful those camo fender flares just tell all your neighbor Neighbors and you&#39;re very taste Village that I&#39;m here look out yeah it&#39;s kind of embarrassing but uh very embarrassing it does what I wanted it to do it seats like 20 people and it goes Offroad really well and it&#39;s exactly what I wanted I have no regrets about buying it many shortcomings you have that and a G wagon parked in front of your Charming New England House you should be embarrassed the G wagon has been great nobody seems to really care about it though actually the wagon&#39;s great it&#39;s a CET it&#39;s the convertible is more Charming cuz it&#39;s weird but I mean man I&#39;m not surprised with the sequ is great off-road that&#39;s why you bought it and like I&#39;m glad it does that um have there been any times that you&#39;ve forgotten to put it into four-wheel drive cuz have to manually put it drive the weirdest thing about the new Sequoia is that unlike every other SUV on the planet you don&#39;t you you&#39;re not driving around in a in an auto four-wheel drive you have to do it yourself there&#39;s a switch like in the old days uh and so yeah no it hasn&#39;t happen yet but I&#39;m terrified where where have you gone like have you gone just I&#39;ve driven I&#39;ll tell you I drove it over the Continental Divide whoa no really though it&#39;s been good and everybody who made fun of me can eat their words if only you could get a picture of it with a bison I will do you want me to do that I&#39;ll do that on the way yeah can you do that on the way back for me please I&#39;ll go to South Dakota or North Dakota whichever place it is uh all right fipo give us something interesting you got tires yeah can I talk about Chevy EVS though you can talk about Chevy ev&#39;s lease deals I see that in our little document but the deal has to be so good that it makes can and drop his draw and if it isn&#39;t can I time him yeah okay if it isn&#39;t if it isn&#39;t that good I am going to um I&#39;m gonna make you drive a Honda prologue I would love to drive a Honda Honda prologue or an Acura CX first gen um slug nice uh here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting about about Chevy EV so in general EVS right now pretty cheap to get Le seals especially quite attractive across the market yeah um Chevy just came out yesterday with the Blazer EV and also with the Equinox EV that nobody has reviewed or talked about but are out like they&#39;re available okay that means you can get an EV that&#39;s brand new to the market 300 something miles a range and the car that just came out yesterday is available for about $330 a month as a leas deal with with what down the eono the this I&#39;m looking at lease hacker which is a great side of diat that the Equinox EV deal that they have pre-negotiated for you is, 1572 do it signing including taxes and fees kenon can you pull up a picture of an equinox EV I have no idea what this he look that&#39;s what&#39;s notable these These are great leaseful when an automaker releases a car into heavy incentives that&#39;s when you know you&#39;re really doing well as a car company looks good and I I I was able to find like one or two reviews and it said that it was good not great but good let me ask you a question let me ask you a question and I mean this With all sincerity in my heart in the past when General Motors would come out with undesirable cars which let&#39;s be honest was almost all of them they were able to sell them without any problem to the rental car companies but now they&#39;ve come out with undesirable electric cars and the rental car companies want nothing to do with this trash so this is what happens so General Motors has been making undesirable cars for my whole life and they used to just Pawn them off on The Fleets Y and now The Fleets won&#39;t even take them which we thought was like the bottom of the barrel like worst case scenario at least The Fleets will take him now they won&#39;t even take him and so now there&#39;s their solution is to release a new car and the moment it is released to offer it with a lease incentive to make it more attractive more affordable do you want to know what the lease deal is if you&#39;re a current Chevy bolt leasy or a GM supplier or like a GM family $12 a month wow it&#39;s a good time if you&#39;re in the market for e lease and you should probably lease one for a bunch of reasons it&#39;s a of course the great humor in all this is then the results of that is they&#39;ll be all over Detroit and then GM Executives will be like we&#39;re selling these in big we&#39;re doing great we&#39;re doing great on these the thing is the the the looks great the Blazer UV looks fine it&#39;s such a good car that Honda is building them alongside it is it&#39;s building the Honda version alongside it so that&#39;s a testament to something I want to talk about the Honda prologue a second can you pull up a picture of that to this day Honda won&#39;t let me review one of these cars because they know I&#39;m going to be mean so I&#39;m just going to be mean without reviewing it let&#39;s do it right now you want prolog or the Acura ZDX which is other I want to talk about the prologue the ZDX is known to be bad the prologue we should just discuss so the the Honda prologue that&#39;s the Honda prologue and and it&#39;s called the prologue because it&#39;s a prologue to them making good cars and the Honda prolog has the following things that are good about it six lug Wheels unfortunately really concerned about them falling off they really want make it has the following things that are bad about it pricing Performance Equipment reliability desirability styling uh all of those so there&#39;s six slug wheels in the Pro column and in the negative column it&#39;s all of everything actually pretty much have you seen one yet nope but I did see an Acura ZDX advertised by the Acura dealer outside of Costco yesterday didn&#39;t I send you a picture of a prologue that I saw on the street I I&#39;ve seen one to be fair I&#39;ve seen one you&#39;ve seen one but we live in San Diego where we see every every new car is that you can find one in San Diego within like a week of it coming out absolutely lots of new cars especially lots of like new EVS not prologs here&#39;s what happens here&#39;s how someone ends up with a prologue I&#39;m going to tell you the story they go into the Honda dealer looking for a CRV hybrid which is a good car a very high highly competent car the dealer says we don&#39;t have any of those or we have two but they&#39;re over sticker but we got an electric car now and it&#39;s called the prologue and the person says oh and they say yeah and we&#39;ll sell it to you for $20,000 off and the person says well what&#39;s the secret and they say it&#39;s $25,000 and they say oh my God they&#39;ll sell me this car for only $5,000 and Honda says yes we will and that&#39;s how that&#39;s what happens more or less I I it&#39;s incredibly hard to disagree with that think you I love when things are consistent or like car stories actually happen I&#39;m sure this will like this like materialize you&#39;re meing it into existence like you do with a lot of other things K you should pick up a Honda prologue cuz I bet you can get one for 85% off I don&#39;t know but I got be honest with you I can&#39;t believe with the e400 or that thinking about that for a can I can I give you can buy my E350 if you want I do not want to any car no offense I don&#39;t want to BU any car you&#39;ve ever that car is it&#39;s very we maintain it well um it&#39;s not clean but we maintain it well um can I tell you a fun fact about the Chevy Blazer sure Eevee uhuh I don&#39;t know if this is still going to be true cuz they keep changing their trims and specs okay yeah when they first announced it it was going to be available as a front-wheel drive vehicle as an all-wheel drive vehicle or as a rear wheel drive vehicle and Kenan I know what you&#39;re thinking what other car is like that and the answer is none and that&#39;s why another reason why the Blazer EV was a terrible car you know the Tesla has the selling points the supercharger the self-driving the great range the performance Chevy&#39;s selling point was we do front-wheel drive we do rear wheeel drive we do all-wheel drive and a result no one has purchased that or the Honda prologue okay can we move on to cars that people actually care about kenon tell us about your M5 and your withdrawals yeah so as many people know yet again I&#39;m talking about my M5 you&#39;re playing the cars and bids drinking game I&#39;ve mentioned my M5 so go ahead and take a sip but um I have been it has been stationary for a while now the by the time this film this comes out it will already be back on the road technically because I have the ABS module is showing up on the this Friday and so it&#39;ll be back I&#39;ll be driving it again should be lovely but of course I&#39;ll be on vacation now and I&#39;m just like I just can&#39;t stop thinking about it like I when I know I&#39;m very grateful that you let me your car I&#39;m very grateful that our friend Kevin let me his WX STI I just realized that I have to be driving something I care about that is interesting to make me happy it has actively made me less happy and less affable to be around because I just missed my car it&#39;s like such an important part of my day and I look forward to driving in your car and that car you although your car is I prefer the SX it&#39;s more fun in my opinion you prefer my f500 bar to your other friends uh impra WX STI hatchback yeah that&#39;s more serious and like really brutally uncomfortable but your car is like is like fun and fizzy and cool but and the STI is cool in a different way I guess but I just miss liking driving I found excuses not to go on as many trips I found reasons not to go out and drive around like I just don&#39;t want to drive and when I do go like out to dinner or something and I want to cruise down PCH it&#39;s just I&#39;m just like eager to get home I&#39;m like I just I&#39;m over it like I just want to be out of the car I don&#39;t want to be in the car that&#39;s how much the M5 means to me that like changes the way that I approach my like life and I just am so thrilled to use it and it&#39;s so enjoyable it makes me so happy and not having it has been made me really sad so I miss I miss it dearly have you considered falling in love with a car that&#39;s reliable you know you know you make them more human you say that filipo but the dude loves the car you know I&#39;ve been thinking about this because I I I think about kenan&#39;s finances more than I think about breathing and water and but I&#39;ve decided that if he you know he loves the car what can you say he he&#39;s it&#39;s changed his life he&#39;s sitting here saying that he&#39;s not as happy of a person on a day-to-day basis because he can&#39;t shift that light gear stick yeah yeah it&#39;s true like you know I also realized like I&#39;ve spent a lot of money on the car and especially recently but and I know I look like an idiot right now not to call BMW classic but they don&#39;t support their cars very very well and for a variety of reasons manufacturers don&#39;t want to fulfill contracts that have expired to make these parts but there are parts that I have bought that you know Ryan has shown me how many are left in the world and I&#39;m not going to look like an idiot in five years when you can&#39;t get some of these basic consumable components you know what you should do is hoard them remember Carl did that when I bought my 4G he bought like seats and steering wheels and stuff and was selling them for like 10x that&#39;s a little like I don&#39;t need seats and steering wheels but I have I have kept around because the steering wheel can be rewrapped and so can seat but I have bought components for the car that will keep it on the road for a very long time and so I know I look stupid now but and I know like replacing the unbodied plastic is ridiculous but when like when you buy components when there are legitimately five of them left on the world and I buy one of them or like my lower timing chain guides when I did the system last year I bought the last ones on the planet you can&#39;t get them anymore and so like this is why you should hoard dude and I&#39;ll tell you something I did this with the 4D GT can go on eBay right now ebay.com go right now type in all right so when I bought my 4D GT my garage situation was such that had just that I scraped the front splitter coming out of my garage right and so I thought to myself this car is out of production this is six seven years ago this car is out of production I&#39;m gonna get a 4GT I&#39;m gonna get two extra front Splitters and I&#39;m gonna really Corner that market and I&#39;ll have them forever so type in for GT front splitter you got to put 4 GT in quotes uh and so I bought two of these front Splitters and I paid 500 bucks and you know what they cost now 500 bucks yeah you you say this but like okay so steering if you want to use the steering wheel example I found out last night the e395 uses the same wheel I I think it is actually a good a good strategy for some reason this particular part didn&#39;t work out for me but generally this is a good idea in theory now I know people who have like duesenbergs who like say they&#39;re actually easier to keep on you think there&#39;s a lot of aftermarket support like the community has risen to make the components themselves but the E39 M5 although there are companies that make parts for that car and some of them are very good and other qualities questionable like it hasn&#39;t risen to that stage yet because it hasn&#39;t needed to it will eventually but I mean but also will it I don&#39;t know who knows thrilled that it brings you that level of joy and that you&#39;re willing to invest that amount of money to keep your level of Joy up well I mean that look you you you have to spend money on things that make you happy and that car makes me so happy every day I&#39;m glad the real question is would a car that had a 10th the miles make you that same car 10 mil make you equally happy and be a better investment here&#39;s the thing no maybe here&#39;s the thing with that is like the stuff I&#39;ve done you will have to do if you have one period you&#39;ll have to do it and when the components are no longer available you&#39;re screwed so like I just don&#39;t I think that H I&#39;m also a believer in one that has miles where every mile I drive it doesn&#39;t actively devalue the car it&#39;s like the happy medium though kenon is is not to daily the car and I think yeah I&#39;m getting to that point I I no we shouldn&#39;t go down that if makes happy to daily drive it he has a car with 235,000 I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t I don&#39;t think you shouldn&#39;t but I&#39;m saying if you wanted to keep the cost down like fipo just said like I think the reality of the situation is the way that people do you&#39;re saying if you have one of these you have to do this but the way to prolong the life of having to do this stuff is by driving it less so if you putting 3,000 miles on the car year instead of 12 some of the parts you are placing at this this comp because you&#39;re using it so much would actually be stretched out three four five years I&#39;m not you should do this I&#39;m not saying you should do this but what I&#39;m saying is like I a suspicion that just few less frequent use would probably Cost You Less yeah well I don&#39;t disagree with that although really some of the parts will time out do the rubber just like degrading over time and like that&#39;s just life and I&#39;ll have to figure that out but like yeah I mean there&#39;s something to it like I&#39;m also very precious about the car like I&#39;ve always been really careful about it now I have so much money into it except for that one time you ran into that poor teacher well that was after that I became really no I was still very precious at that time and that was one of the worst and most traumatizing experiences of my life so thank you for bringing that up you&#39;re so but nonetheless like I just adore that car I just think it is the coolest I went and sat in it the other day and I was like oh man I just missed this car I&#39;m really I think this shows the different the key difference between Canada and I my car starts having issues that I&#39;m like I&#39;m GNA Le a lot of most people you don&#39;t you&#39;re not driving an iconic special you&#39;re driving a an E-class station wagon we have to move on we have to move on we have to move on we have to move on to the market report market report marker marker rep Doug start us off report is brought To Us by cars and bids cars and bids on online auction platform you visit carsand bids.com you list your car there for free we sell the car we get all the money anything else F the you as a seller received the actual money it doesn&#39;t all come to us no no we sell the you list the car we get all the money it&#39;s great it&#39;s wonderful we will get you the most money is maybe what doug meant to say all right okay couple things on market report and then we&#39;re going to move on to questions because we kind of skipped it last week uh Kenan here&#39;s something incredible for you you should be talking about type in Audi RS5 to the search bar oh yeah I know what you&#39;re going to say a great car are you aware that those V8 ones which were only sold for two model years yes 156 right it was 15 16 are now 25 Grand that&#39;s that&#39;s wild to me this is a beautiful car styled by an Italian like all beautiful cars were it is a naturally aspirated V8 400 50 horsepower oh they were tip only which is kind of a drawback but it is beautiful it is na8 it is fast it&#39;s faster than anything fipo has even ever driven and it sells for 25,000 us and it&#39;s rare it is a rare and special car yeah I love those if if one of my co-workers at the Exotic Car Dealership I worked at Arthur had one of these in white and oh man every time he showed up in it it just looks it&#39;s so cool great car that engine too 13 14 15 those were the moders three years but they&#39;re very very very very rare cars they didn&#39;t make a lot of them and since then they switched the RS5 to a tur turbo V6 which by the way has less power than the original na so even to this day the RS5 has less power than the original V8 one that came out back in 2013 25 Grand 25 Grand with with 40,000 miles K FIP how come you haven&#39;t bought one of these um that&#39;s a good question it&#39;s too old for you and doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s so beautiful is such a beautiful car you can tell when you look at that car that an Italian design it can can I jump off still looks good that&#39;s H all right I have a question for you well there&#39;s another sports car that&#39;s around the same price now 20 to 25k okay which is focus rs&#39;s somehow they have plummeted in like the last six months and kenon which would you rather have I mean very fair great it&#39;s a legitimate question though it&#39;s it&#39;s a couple model difference yes no it&#39;s not you only buy manual cars this is a manual well yeah but than that but other than that this is like the WRX and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not I hate this and you would love an RS5 I would have an RS5 as a daily and some manual sports car and you could that&#39;s an amazing garage you put it together for 50 Grand RS5 and a 996 that is a great garage for $50,000 and every time you take out your car you&#39;re driving something special and every time you take out your car you&#39;re driving something faster than a filipo mobile I mean fact yeah that&#39;s bar low bar to clear but it&#39;s a very low hurdle um but you&#39;re right I agree Focus RS as have gotten cheaper car I would choose the rs52 even boom everyone would choose the RS5 they&#39;re absolute bargains they look incredible God look at the RS5 that slab-sided beauty yeah it is I remember vividly when these cars came out and I remember seeing an A5 just for the very first time in my I have pictures of it I took on like with a cellone camera in Period and it just like it and yeah it is a very good looking very very very good of course the current Five series looks identical so but the current yeah well that&#39;s because it was beautiful exactly like Ram Audi realized hey we had we let&#39;s exploit this Italian who designed this car for us and let&#39;s just let it run forever because it was the only beautiful thing we ever created what what&#39;s the name of the Italian that designed it Walter D Sila you know him probably personally it&#39;s a small country first Walter yeah yes um and it&#39;s such a cool car and yes of course they&#39;re still using that design by the way an interesting fact and this is Ford admitting the Focus RS is not as good as the Audi RS5 you know the best package of the Focus RS was called the RS 2 nice that&#39;s so great well done okay I have a market report topic for us that&#39;s going to be controversial but I think it&#39;s time that someone says it we all want to say it fipo wanted to say it for years it&#39;s time to talk about thought it for years the mercedesbenz w124 and w126 okay so the w124 was the E-class that was sold from 86 to 95 but more importantly the w126 was the S-Class that was sold from like 83 until like yesterday no until like 91 and there has been like speculation that these cars will become desirable at some point and they never have and I have decided after a lot of consideration that they never will they simply never will people come to me and they&#39;re like I got a perfect w126 560 seal pull these up kenon type in 560 seal and and people are like I got a really really perfect one low miles it&#39;s incredible you know what that&#39;s worth 10 12 and the reason is actually Mercedes made the cars too good they are incredibly iable they are incredibly durable they never break they never fail and so it&#39;s actually quite easy to find a low mileage nice version of this car we&#39;ve sold ones with 40,000 and 20,000 miles for 20 grand the great shoot up of 88 560 seal values has never come and will never come they are simply too good and too preserved and too easy to find so many of them yeah you are a problem to have you you are right I&#39;m glad that somebody was finally brave enough to say it out that I really believe it though because I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people who are like yeah I&#39;m hard I got a few of these 560sl or I&#39;m thinking about getting one because values can&#39;t stay low forever and I&#39;m here to say they will they are they will they&#39;re never going to increase so go and drive it and enjoy it one 12 fours are interesting because I feel like one 123s had a Heyday they and they there&#39;s something but not a ton no you&#39;re right about that but only a very specific one two three like a turbo diesel wagon with low miles and even then it&#39;s not like it ever got to 100 Grand like an air cooled 911 like it it that was a reare car to begin with especially kept in nice shape but the 560s are even more common in nice shape s-classes in general were preserved better because they were always nicer cars and se&#39;s S they just they didn&#39;t break they were made really well and they&#39;re just not rare and they&#39;re not they&#39;re not hard to find in nice shape great Market Insight Douglas it&#39;s a $10,000 car it is all day it&#39;s the it might be the best $10,000 car in the world no because the car you&#39;re about to talk about I think is the best $10,000 car $6,000 car in the world oh man pull it up pull tell kenon o we sold on cars and bids recently we&#39;ve sold two unmodded o this one no the sedan and you can click on the wagon but the sedan too wow $7,400 I I legitimately thought about buying this car no you didn&#39;t this car this car wow unmodded just like so clean for Seven Grand wow okay so here&#39;s here&#39;s a theory I have about these I&#39;ve been sitting on the beach a lot just thinking about car market here&#39;s the theory I have about these are we calling that work or just the the Integra Type R okay that&#39;s a car that has now become very valuable a nice Integra Type R is like a $50,000 car yeah tell me why this is any different this car is more powerful it has all-wheel drive as opposed to front-wheel drive it is probably rarer yes the integr type R at 190 horsepower this at 227 uh it is probably rarer in unmodified Nice condition because people knew to save the itrs and they didn&#39;t save the apreas tell me why an O2 WRX in like 15 years doesn&#39;t start to become like a super turbo or a z32 300ZX start I think you said it because people knew to preserve the other car and so I I think it&#39;s like that Mystique is just like grown and grown and grown I don&#39;t know these you&#39;re talking about an exceptional exam exceptional examples being worth a lot of money one day I agree $7,400 is ridiculously got 112,000 miles to be quick this car is a bargain yeah I I think it I actually agree with you that it is a bargain but it just isn&#39;t uh it I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t put my finger on why but you know why because Subaru made slightly improved version of these and Acura never made another good car they made the RSX Type S made never made car that&#39;s a little extrem a little extreme but you get the pointx type S what sir they made the RSX Type S that&#39;s not something it had sixspeed manual one more gear it had more power 20 more horses it was also a VTEC it was also all that stuff and in Canada they sold base model RSX with hubcaps this to be fair the RSX is worth identical to what the to what this WRX is worth they&#39;re all wor nice RSX pipe s is worth like 30 and this WX is undervalued what what since one has a night like that one was special but it&#39;s also an outlier the rest are worth 20 nice RSX Type s&#39;s bring money we just sold one for 15 we just sold another one for 18 if you had an o2x an O2 WRX is not selling for 18 even if it had one mile and kenon licked the steering wheel Valor I don&#39;t want my saliva on stering I would then clean it with leather cleaner car is a future Classic this car changed the world it brought Japanese performance cars back to the US after they all went away it was the video game car the first one that came Evo didn&#39;t come to low three GTR didn&#39;t come to low 7 this thing showed up and said yes we will try performance cars in America and now they sell they are relegated to the corners of cars and bids where they sell for for Seven Grand it is a TR so what you&#39;re saying is that Mercedes-Benz is drive those cars not worth anything so you you want to put a date on when this one will be worth something just like you did with the Land Cruiser a couple weeks ago because I have it in my calendar I&#39;ll I add it this one give me yeah okay well I&#39;ll tell you another thing 2.5 rs&#39;s this is the real travesty of the whole thing the the previous model was was was sold from in the US from 94 to 01 WX in preses they never did a WX but they did a 2 5 RS which was the performance version with 165 horsepower naturally aspirated nice 2.5 RS is sell for like 30 and this car which has 60 more horsepower is $77,000 so I don&#39;t know when it&#39;s going to happen Kenan but it&#39;s going to happen the moral story is according to Doug if you have one of these cars and it&#39;s very nice and very clean and very unmodified no one does hold on to it exactly this one was it and you missed it so congratulations to whoever won this one it is quite a car I want that thing so bad I mean I mean look when you go into the known flaws section you see a front end collision at 04 a rear end collision at 06 peeling clear coat front bumper shows signs of repaint foggy headlight lenses seepage under the engine the seller himself describes the ride as bouncy due to worn struts and shocks there&#39;s rust on the underbody engine bay wiper arms and real wheel AR and the air conditioning doesn&#39;t work but other than those problems this so this is so what do you think someone&#39;s going to modify the ever living crap out of this now yes this car is done dude kenon this car already has had the engine taken out of it it&#39;s already got some sort of weird short block in it and it&#39;s on bad wheels and it&#39;s already it&#39;s already on Neons can can I ask you a related question when will the current WRX become worth something uh it the current value of the new of the current WX is actually the highest that it ever be so correct okay I want to move on to questions I want to move on to questions we have questions and we have to take them because the people want to know things with pleasure they want to know things now remember you can ask your own questions you go to carsand bids.com you click on community and there will be a post there that directs you to ask questions and we will answer the highest upvoted questions no matter how bad they are we will answer them right they&#39;re usually very good to be clear can you remind the people what carsand bids.com is all about carsand bids.com it&#39;s an auction website okay so here&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do we&#39;re gonna take now last week we only took a couple questions because we had a longer market report seg because we had John tamaran come in guest St and he was excellent this week we&#39;re gonna take all the questions we didn&#39;t take last week plus more okay so we begin with a question from IND can question for Doug Kennan and filipo what is one feature from an older discontinued car that you wish was standard on Modern cars that is tell you the answer but I&#39;m curious your thoughts that is a good one that is a good fipo do you need me to tell you um well I keep thinking please do tell us your guys are gonna agree with this and then we&#39;re going to move on but the 1998 Lincoln Navigator had climate controls on the steering wheel the Prius does that now maybe did it I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t know what the inside of a new Prius looks like but that was a thing in the first few GS first three Gs so if you wanted to increase the AC you it&#39;s just like how your car has steering wheel radio controls they had climate controls whoa you say whoa but that&#39;s a good Fe did it from 03 to I don&#39;t know when it is a good feature it is hard I had it a one Prius and I didn&#39;t have that I should have said second gen or third gen depending on your definition on the that is my defin there was came out not three um and I think it was 04 actually um okay do you have a better exam answer no that&#39;s a good one a feature that was from the old school oh you know another one is vent windows on the front ah yeah that would be nice yeah those are nice I would like headlights that when something goes wrong just keep working like just replace a bulb that&#39;s not a feature that old car&#39;s hand no but I have feelings about her dipsticks dipsticks is a great one a great one well when we were in in Italy we spent some time with my sister who had also had a rental car and she had an an Audi A4 wagon rental car wow nice she got to check your oil level light right cuz it&#39;s a 6,000 kilometer Audi and that&#39;s what happens yes Jes it is exclusively in the infotainment system so like okay what do you want me to do drive it around for 20 minutes and then it&#39;ll tell me the oil level but then I can&#39;t do anything about it cuz it like yells at you if you open the hood and the engine hot there&#39;s no dipstick there&#39;s no dip stick whatsoever it&#39;s just it&#39;s so simple it was technology that worked I will stick with my yeah it&#39;s a key that you twist to turn on the car I like but I&#39;m sticking with the dtick I think what are you a por 911 ftic we used to I&#39;m like a quarter step removed from quarter step is right all right now we know dipti that is not an acceptable answer diti is an acceptable answer dipstick is probably the right answer although the climate you and I win he came up with nothing true okay next question from oh yes yes Doug a billionaire offers you $3 million to drive to Barrow Alaska in the heart of Winter in your Countach uh you&#39;re allowed to use anything necessary to complete this journey but if it&#39;s late fall and but if you&#39;re late or fail you get nothing and you&#39;re presumably stuck in central Alaska or equivalent with a Countach apparently in January he didn&#39;t say that at the start uh would you do it million is the 3 million taxable fipo what do you think no okay um yeah I&#39;d probably do it I think I could do it would you do I&#39;ll go with you if you give me something from that $3 million would we have to fix it or what no you could use a $3 million to fix it bring some tools you&#39;re allowed to use anything necessary to complete the journey well I bring I&#39;d bring George Evans and I&#39;d charge him whatever he want i&#39; tell him I&#39;d give him half million and then I get two and a half million and we definitely make it there go you could just talk about Countach just the whole way and L m2s and all those car we we would talk about what we would do with the money um what amount of money would you do it for like what&#39;s the minimum oh that&#39;s a good question Pro I&#39;d probably do it for uh well what would George Evans do it for because he&#39;s riding with me you know that&#39;s that starts to become the problem uh would either of you do this yes for for for notably less money I don&#39;t have you do it for what would I have to pay you to do you do it for 100,000 in in what car so L I&#39;d probably do it for 100,000 the count oh yeah i&#39; as long as like that the 100,000 doesn&#39;t include taxes like snow tire yeah I would do for 100,000 no questions asked it would be long that&#39; be fine it would be exciting it would be I&#39;ve never been to Alaska not after the third day no as long as I have my air P pod so I can kind because the noise is very exciting in short burst but man you got to drown that stuff out cu those carbs are I got a I got a stereo in there I listen to music yeah it&#39;s really not good um that&#39;s not the point of the car it&#39;s an interesting premise I mean there is a guy who drives it&#39;s not a Kos but a guy with a 308 Brian&#39;s questional decisions on Instagram has driven his 308 I think he drove it to Dead Horse laska which memory serves is the most Northerly town in the United States I believe not Amer but he drove that through Canada drove it back drives all over the West skiing and you can see his car constantly he hasn&#39;t posted in a year I wonder what happened got tired there&#39;s a but he was leaving some National Park the throttle cable snapped and he had to like figure it out on the side of the road and it&#39;s just so cool like that&#39;s so interesting it&#39;s such an we did that right yeah but the keychain that keychain work replaced a throttle or fixed a throttle cable on the side of the road that is exactly righted no cold ones all right okay next question from Bradley Bronson keep sell or destroy Mercedes AC class Mitsubishi Mirage B9 Tribeca I okay I know which of these is my favorite but I don&#39;t know if I want to keep it or not I the a class is your favorite you want no no no no no the B9 Tribeca is the absolute favorite of these I will keep that one I will sell the a class I will destroy the Mirage yeah that&#39;s the answer Ken do you have for what it&#39;s worth the B9 tra is the one that&#39;s worth the least out of these so no point in selling that one I&#39;m partial it&#39;s traffic to me next question also from Bradley Bronson Doug when will you buy a Fiat multiply Fleet B do you want to answer that one Doug and I have talked extensively about whether we should buy if you have multip if you think we should write to Doug personally and convince him no I don&#39;t know I kind of want one but it&#39;s so hard to find a answer for me is never but I would contribute to Fiat to Filippo&#39;s Fiat multiple fun it might happen at some point dude the one I drove at Lane was good it was like I&#39;m not screwing with you it was legitimately good to drive it&#39;s it&#39;s a great car I only saw one in three weeks in Italy I saw one field multiplay first I remember when I went to ital in 11 yeah no 10 they were pretty around and these days second gen ones are around second gen are around yeah you see second gen you need a first you don&#39;t want that want they made it look normal if I want a second I&#39;m just gonna buy an Opel of f instead that&#39;s exactly right if I wanted if I wanted a normal looking car I&#39;d get an opal zafira I actually like how the Opel zafira looks it it&#39;s kind of like a second gen field multiple yeah that&#39;s true or any other MPV so there right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big yor you know what it looks like is the K Rondo um which fun fact was sold in the US with seven seats Kenan doesn&#39;t know what that is no nor does he believe that you could fit seven humans in it how often do you think a car comes up that Kenan is never even heard of but was sold in the United stains every I tell you three times in the last question but La class wasn&#39;t sold in the US though so yeah okay okay this is next question is a great one this is for me and kenon F you can step out of this one Luke 26 what would you rank every generation 911 from best to worst best do you know the 911 gen&#39;s well enough to do this he doesn&#39;t yeah of course I do no no I&#39;m saying you phip I&#39;m saying you kenon phip go out man best 993 997 after 993 you got to go 964 after 993 I think you think the 964 is better than 997 I think the 993 is the only good one no I&#39;m kidding um wow damn a purist well wouldn&#39;t I have said a gbody okay 993 worst is I mean I hate to say it but like I&#39;m not a 991 992 guy and I&#39;m not an old school guy so like the old cars the 60s ones can duke it out with the with the Tiptronic stuff H and then you put 996 above those that&#39;s a good question damn okay 993 I still think 997 I mean you&#39;re talking about just the base 911 or like the whole range of 911s you pick a 997 over a 964 I mean that feel of that air cooled with the old school shift cable I mean that&#39;s those are it is I mean but again like so it&#39;s we&#39;re just comparing bass model 911 is what you&#39;re saying I think we&#39;re talking about the whole range GT3 RS 4 ler I mean you&#39;re going to say that you&#39;d rather be driving a a I guess you well the comparison to that would be a turbo 36 but right I mean a turbo 36 Co car and I would rather have that then well I don&#39;t know four liter is pretty cool um that is difficult to say that is really hard if if you if it were Bas 911 to base 911 that is a more apt comparison it changes let&#39;s say it&#39;s B 91 base 911 99 three 999 one I love I do love the 991 and the base one is really good and I won&#39;t want this as a daily at some point I think it&#39;ll be really fun yeah 964 997 996 is the Pu does the puffy count no no Puff the old stuff which I don&#39;t get into well it would be I guess it would be G for you would be gbody above the like the K body even then though not my thing yeah I don&#39;t know yes yeah I&#39;d have to come back to that I really have to think about that one but yeah I do think I agree 993 is the best and I agree that the early stuff for me it&#39;s like I&#39;m not as interested in any of that if I had I&#39;m thinking now if I had them all sitting here lined up with the keys in them what would you rather get into 993 first the second one I would rather get into is not a 997 it would be a 964 and then the next one I would get into for base 911s would be a 991 probably and then probably a 996 and then a 997 I know that&#39;s very or 997 intriguing I would put the 997 above the 996 but and I love the 996 but I think that like yeah base I I think we we&#39;re close I think I would do 99 993 I think yeah 993 997 991 9964 then kind of I guess 992 also is down there down n okay here&#39;s an interesting one what if it was turbos o uh 993 yeah is the best number one but then 997 yeah and then 964 probably probably 964 is next this is a great this is a great version of the question because it neutralizes the the new ones because you wouldn&#39;t want the automatics right that&#39;s so true it does uh yeah I would say uh after yeah h man yeah I think I agree I think I probably would put the 996 above the 930 um but 930 is so cool but yeah I I would do that it would go 993 997 um 964 996 930 I apologize to anybody who&#39;s not a Porsche fan you guys are doing this I&#39;ve been thinking about my favorite Porsche McAn generation from best the only one okay we have one more question one more question one more question one more question and it comes to us from AC 1592 and the question no let&#39;s do this question from Amron if you all had to pick one car to own from each other&#39;s car history what would it be oh whole history well that&#39;s easy for kenon very easy but yeah from yours I mean I don&#39;t want a 525 35 35 I don&#39;t want the 355 no no no 355 uh it&#39;s easy for me for a dog it&#39;s got to be the that&#39;s the coolest car G it&#39;s got a v Lama V you keep it I want to hear those cars going you know it&#39;s just sucking away I just want to hear I just love the Kos every time I get to start it for you is a good day I feel better when I leave I just it&#39;s so cool sure not the well no you start the way I started it&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t because I know how to operate it um but but I just love I just think that car is the coolest damn thing it&#39;s so awesome Doug from your car history I I would choose either the 4D GT or your E63 AMG wagon E450 alterrain is what you should choose he3 mg wag you forit the alter and you should choose it in real life too no I would choose fiat&#39;s Filippo&#39;s Fiat yeah you don&#39;t want my um e53 X5 stick Kon thought about that but no n what about my your ath is the coolest for sure yeah is the coolest it is fun it&#39;s rough but that&#39;s fun those are good questions they were all lovely oh by the way there&#39;s one other question I want to answer it&#39;s from Alex f505 he says when cars and bids first started in 2020 the cut off for cars do model year 1980 how was this decided 1981 and was there a lot of thought put into the exact year first off the the premise is wrong it was never 1980 the cut off was always 1981 and the reason for this is and to answer the second part of the question the 17-digit VIN came in 1981 which we felt when we were launching the business would make everything a lot easier to verify in terms of Carfax and just like vin it&#39;s very difficult to keep track of pre-1980 car pre 1981 cars and serial numbers and you start getting into like block stamping and things like that and it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot more challenging and so 1981 was always the cut off because of the 17d digit finin and and also you know the 80s and I mean that that those two things kind of were able to combine and and we do turn down by the way 1980 model cars we don&#39;t sell those we never have sold those correct um and there&#39;s never been a 1980 car on Cars and it&#39;s only 81 to the present correct that was off camera sorry my microphone uh okay there we go that was our finest podcast ever Kenan I hope you&#39;re enjoying Monteray car week which was where you are right now I&#39;ll come with stories for the next podcast what&#39;s that I will come with stories to aail everyone with from for the next podcast fipo meanwhile fix your headlights you got to be able to see indeed goodbye everyone goodbye a"
