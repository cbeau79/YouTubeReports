opposition from Europe Prov provides the best possible experience and grounding for his young Reds to learn from and Saturday of course in the Premier League 2 opener a very young Liverpool under 21s did the club proud beating Manchester City 3-1 so that will certainly get the confidence going for this one tonight delighted to be alongside in the company for the first time this season great to have him back as well great to have all you folks with us wherever you may be from all around the world with us as always through our live Academy coverage this season hope you&#39;ve had a fantastic summer with your family and friends it is of course former red Neil M yeah thanks very much Steve looking forward to the game and despite it still being classed as summer in August it&#39;s still windy and cold as usual at Kirby yeah these are good games really good games for the for the youngsters to play in different sort of opposition different sort of Challenge and what you find with these games is the opposition tend to be a little bit more settled in the in the team you know I think we&#39;ll see a number of changes again and we see that lot don&#39;t we under 21 level compared to perhaps at under 18 level for Liverpool right then folks as always we will start with a closer check on today&#39;s lineups and let&#39;s first of all have a look at Liverpool I can tell you head coach Barry lutus has made five changes from Saturday&#39;s team against Manchester City kol Figaroa who is stepping up from the under 18s this season makes his first start at this level so too does Kyle Kelly also from the 18s and there&#39;s also a a dead debut for the under 21s for our 17-year-old goalkeeper Cornell misu who did so well last season youthful Center back pairing who did so well at this level last season in Carter pinnington Amara nallo great to see Tom Hill out there as well fully fit again and hopefully getting stronger and stronger scored a great goal and James Norris you know what you get what a fantastic professional James Norris is he&#39;ll play anywhere for the team after that loan at trir last year we&#39;re looking forward to seeing kieren Morrison still only 17 he was brilliant for the under 18s last season making the big step up this year to the 21s as for the opposition PSV well Al alons gron andik in charge of their site he makes two changes to the team that beat John atterberg&#39;s olds side utre at the weekend in their league opener plenty of quality on the flanks of course with aod Deli Thomas a Dutch under 17 International he used to be on the box of Hest slots former Club at fire and also on that right hand side The Talented Israel under 20 International Tai Abed you&#39;ve got Ty goand and Isaac badi Dutch youth Internationals in Midfield and then the young Turkish player emier bar just off the captain yesper unin who will lead the line so they have a lot of quality this PSV side they&#39;ve reached the final of this trophy the last two years they won it 2022 23 and they lost on N to Crystal Palace in the final last season but great to see Tom Hill out there big night as well for Cornell mcure as to say still only 17 this young goalkeeper we signed from H but talked about Tom Hill before you know what people tend to forget is how long this lad has been on the sidelines he had that ACL injury which kept him out for about 18 months he&#39;s had some tough times he really has with the injuries he&#39;s had and the mental strength he&#39;s shown to to come back he&#39;s scored a cracking goal didn&#39;t he at the weekend against Manchester City a great result for the lads as well you know to start the season really well full of confidence I think when you look at the lineup as well it is very young like you say there&#39;s number of players with the transfer window open who who may well be getting low moves and and would have definitely strengthened this lineup tonight and as well unfortunately he&#39;s part and parcel of football there is a few injuries of players who can&#39;t play Josh Davidson hasn&#39;t kicked the ball over preseason yet we hopefully Josh will be back soon we know how influential and indeed versatile a player Josh Davidson can be Oakley caner has had his injury problems he he can&#39;t play tonight sadly so it gives an opportunity to krol Figaroa who&#39;s been away with the USA youth Squad and scored a fair few goals for them can he step up now at 21&#39;s level yeah we hope so you know we&#39;re certainly hope so it will be difficult a different sort of challenge for these young players because they are still learning the game but also developing physically and you have to remind yourself that they are two three years younger than some of the opposition players they&#39;re coming up against tonight and also don&#39;t forget Bar L is still with without jadden Dans because of the back problem you know Trent K doy has not kicked the ball all preseason he might have been one of those young players after impressing the last two years since arriving for m a lot of people were speculating would he get a chance on the tour will he picked up a a little niggle towards the end of last season he&#39;s working his way back he is out on the field running again with Isaac Maya two good players so you know hopefully they can get back in you know we still don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen with a number of these young players before the transfer window shots in terms of loans but the players that Barry lutus has at his disposal tonight and looking there spoken about Tom Hill Kon Morrison you know he was electric for the 18s last season 13 goals numerous assists he started life well with the 21 I tell you what I really liked about Morrison last season he&#39;s seen his mates Dan and Kum has progressed to the 21s and even around the first team and he&#39;s been the one to really try and keep going with the 18s and he did he was absolutely superb didn&#39;t let that disappointment put put him put him off and Michael lafy stepping up we saw him step up towards the back end of last season with the 2 with the 21s the O the scouser good competitor Tommy pilling will play as the sixth the holding player he played on the left side of the attack at the week and did really well got an assist to his name good good professional so interesting test these and as always besides PSV also in the group Sparta Prague Hera BSC and Nord charland as well so all these games are played in England you only play each other once and this Premier League International cup is in the 10th year which pits 12 of England&#39;s best Academy sides against the top 12 development teams from Europe and as I say they&#39;ve done really well beaten finalists last year they won it the year before got a good tradition of bringing players through their Academy to First Team level PSV yeah yeah they&#39;ve been the final three times let you say the last two years and previously eight or nine years ago against Villa roale so they do have good pedigree in this tournament we&#39;ve never been to the final of course yet maybe it can be our year this year early touch of the goalkeeper Nick shiks up towards Michael bressa the Dutch under 17 International they play quick football they pretty good on the Counterattack some of the Liverpool coaches were telling me so we that it be a good Examination for these boys but Barry luus always sets his teams out in really good fashion let thread away the pace of Thomas here Morrison doing his defensive duties to help Terrence miles deal with that threat yeah I mean we talk about this being a a young under 21 lineup but the back four in place for Liverpool they they played that last game if you remember against Spurs last season absolute cracking game wasn&#39;t it ended up losing on penalties unfortunately but played ever so well and so you&#39;re looking at the experience you know nor is certainly one of those miles as well he&#39;s a real experienced campaigner out there and to help some of the younger players in pining to analo coming short there Kyle Kelly Kyle Kelly by the way is the one Liverpool player out there who&#39;s a full International made his International debut for St kits and nitz last season at the age of 18 really again it&#39;s about development isn&#39;t it for these young players experiences what what better play international football Abed the Israel youth International has support from Tao land radii there&#39;s vessel Kun switching it out towards aad Deli Thomas the 17year old and of course the one thing that PSV won&#39;t be used to is the famous Kirby wind Mills no yeah I mean what we have seen a couple of minutes haven&#39;t we but comfortable in possession of the ball I think they will be patient about Liverpool being organized disciplined as well doing the jobs of making sure that PSV don&#39;t find those spaces to try and hurt us aardi Michael bressa is&#39;s rfh vanit forward from fullback and all of these players in inside the PSV they&#39;re all Dutch youth Internationals yeah yeah Pressa Panda black you can see the patience can&#39;t they have it in the left wing and rather than thinking they want to cross the ball they&#39;ll get it back to the center half they get it to the right wing and back to the center half now back at the goalkeeper and that&#39;s the big difference the big learning curve isn&#39;t it for some of these lads who are stepping up now from the under 18s to this under 21s team they&#39;re not used to not having the ball so Barry lucus was saying to me it&#39;s a different experience we want these to have to get used to not having the ball and you got to find different ways to try and unlock the opposition yeah and not get too frustrated you know yes they want to be on the ball but it&#39;s about having that discipline making sure that you&#39;re in the right position to to help the team and I&#39;m working hard to win it back yeah Dominic cores on the bench he was very influential in the win against City at the weekend after that lone spell in Switzerland the Swiss Super League played a fair few games on loan there at yon Sport and there was one or two on the bench likes of him and Lee Jonas who&#39;s just gone back from a long-term injury actually so they&#39;re on they&#39;re on restricted minutes so that&#39;s why they can&#39;t start so Barry&#39;s got to shuffle the pack yeah both played it the weekend you know they were part of that Victory against City like you say I must admit I haven&#39;t seen oh here we go oh and Figaroa was nearly in there he feels as though he was he was clipped it was Kyle Kelly actually pressing Kyle Kelly around the edge of that penalty area Steve it looked like there was contact there Figaroa laffy well the question is if the ref doesn&#39;t say it the lono&#39;s got to see it for me it felt like there was contact you can see Tom Hill he&#39;s having a word with the ref how have you not seen it that&#39;s where the Lono has to help the referee we just heard Barry luta and our effects Mike say exactly the same as you did he says how did you not see that big call big decision yeah he&#39;s in on goal it was a short back pass it was a mistake yeah had the back laps in concentration now Cornell mcure born in scarra a Polish parents had a terrific first season with the under 18s last year following his arrival from P City just got to be careful with those Square passes you can see that PSV were alert to intercept it big this is though isn&#39;t it really big decision that the officials have missed early on in the game and it happens there are going to be errors from the officials and this is again something that the players have to learn it will happen not just at this level it&#39;ll happen in the first team taking a lot of throwin and free kicks quickly the Dutch side so far here in Kirby we can&#39;t get a kick at the moment but as much as they&#39;ve kept the ball that&#39;s how goalkeeper touched it I think you you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head before mels that the key point is not to get frustrated for these young players Thomas trying to get goal side of Terrence miles good defending there from Carter Pennington yeah just covered his near post nicely as the cross came in here is that early opportunity you see bit over playing at the back and Kyle Kelly&#39;s in here yeah I mean Kyle Kelly&#39;s in that&#39;s a foul he&#39;s clipped him it&#39;s a foul yeah not quite the best camera angle for that one sort of but you can see if he doesn&#39;t catch him Kyle Kelly&#39;s in there one V one yeah yeah can we do an age check on that goalie he&#39;s looks like he&#39;s going B reminds me of David Raven back in the day rvo yeah back in your team yeah he&#39;s only 20 Nick sheeks they they actually played a more experienced goalkeeper 28 on Friday James Norris there who had that lone spell at trir overs last season after a difficult start he did well in the second part of the Season Nigel Atkins give him a chance he did well good block by lafy and Away by Norris again Vander black the right back from PSV Emanuel Vander black who joined PSV from Sami Hooper&#39;s old team vills fight what a spot that was by the Colossus our old Chief Scout Ron Yates by the way to get Sami Hooper from a a team that probably not many people would have heard of at the time in villam VI Brin yeah absolutely what a lad what a player he proved to be Skipper as well you know and what why he was such a great Pro he was Captain and he was he was all right with Stevie taking it off him you know some players will be a little bit upset by that with the old ego but not big he was more than happy to let Stevie have the captain&#39;s arm band so as to say folks all of these games are in England in this tournament the top two from each group and then the two best third place teams make the quarterfinals Pressa Vander black patient play by the Wayside here in Kirby are they&#39;re trying to hit Liverpool on the break with the pace of Thomas good covering there by Tommy pilling now Morrison Tommy pilling the 17-year-old who has been at the Academy since the age of five in the right place at the right time yeah getting back defensively good play there from pilling from Midfield decision to be made wasn&#39;t it with that ball over the top I wondered if Mishu may go for it sometimes the goalkeeper may may get a little bit lost in that situation stayed in his goal and in the end let the players come back and and deal with that situation well Figaroa Kelly Norris good Center forward play you know the ball&#39;s gone up to Figaroa there he&#39;s up against big set and a half and he gets his body in front and just looks after the ball ni for Liverpool and that&#39;s going to be important you know Liverpool haven&#39;t seen a lot of the ball in these early stages so we have to keep it when we do get it he&#39;s such a great kid figy they call him Kell Figaro I just my big wish for him this year is an extended run of games because the last few years he&#39;s been hit by injury problems which have really hampen his progress as an under 18 player that as I say turns 18 at the end of this month and it will do his confidence the world of good getting that start tonight in a game like this yeah and and he&#39;s a player who knows where the back of the net is and like any Center forward you want to be out there consistently and then the goals will come he&#39;s nearly in wasn&#39;t he for that early chance with that back pass here&#39;s vessel Kun vit driving from Midfield Isaac badi stopped by pilling lafy just after he lost possession Michael lafy could see maybe what was going to happen there yeah yeah the shout From the Bench we just do it a little bit quicker you know he got there initially that slight delay cuz these boys were a little bit older were on top of them very quickly too land here&#39;s Tom Hill now 21 Tom Hildy Liverpool skipper Pennington Kelly now a bit of space here for lafy Hill Morrison first opportunity here for the 17year old Tom Hill made the Run oh nearly yeah really good position initially wasn&#39;t it from Tom Hill Just In Between the Lines picks the ball up here nice nicely on the half turn and that&#39;s where you want Morrison One V one can you get the fullback recognizes really good run from Hill Central just slightly overhit but encouraging from Liverpool to try and get in behind PSV defense of course great to have playing European opposition at Kirby it&#39;s something they&#39;re going to have on a regular basis with the return of the UFA Youth League man yeah yeah absolutely great to be back in the champions league isn&#39;t it you know we missed it last season Europa League for the first team but it&#39;s back in its new format D does anybody understand it yet you worked it out yet it&#39;s eight games rather than six yeah some exciting games that&#39;s for sure yeah but I don&#39;t like looking at a league knowing that I&#39;m not playing everybody in it and it&#39;s the same for these boys in this league we&#39;ve got United Fulham and Norwich in this league but we don&#39;t play teams from our own country in this competition I know but they look at the league and go united if we&#39;re top United a second and and you want to play somebody in your league anyway we&#39;ll see that in the Champions League this year because that&#39;s what we always talk about being back in your day when you played for Liverpool coming through the ranks you didn&#39;t have what these boys had playing European opposition in competitive games did you no we&#39;d always gone TOS European tours wherever it would be Spain somewhere like that and and play against teams but it wouldn&#39;t be as often as what these boys are getting those experiences and they are invaluable and more and more you&#39;re getting a lot of these Europeans players from round the world coming into the English leagues and I have to get used to playing against how different they can be Terence miles bursting forward the scouser but got to be careful out of position now and ping have to cover it right back basadi con good work there by Figaroa I think also it helps the experience of playing against them at under 19 UEFA youth league so if you do get to playing Europe for the first team you&#39;ve had that little Tas of playing against those sort of oppositions and these sort of games as well you know how many times have we done these games five six years ago whatever it is maybe a Trent played in it maybe Curtis Jones and it will have helped them for when they have played in the first team against some of the European teams good pressing Again by Liverpool pilling nicely done by Tommy pilling there did really well was a good player wasn&#39;t it two three PSV players around smart turn there clever footwork wins the free kick for Liverpool back with Cornell mcor working it well here this is bars well stopped by nalo who had experience going away with the first team didn&#39;t he Amar nalo Kelly n again who came in with with try Neon nallo came in from West Ham United&#39;s Academy last season started life in the 18s quickly moved up along with try to the 21s yeah it was good to see so many of the academy players get minutes in preseason I mean Tre na only really got the ID with some of his performances got himself a goal at anfield that was a nice moment against seevilla as well brilliant goal wasn&#39;t it great goal Thomas Tai Abed who came in in 2021 from Harel Aviv working it well this is Teo land with a dangerous ball in half cleared and Miles again with a double block yes some good defending but I thought he was offside initially flag never went open in the end it was Miles who had to defend the far post and then they was a blocking there wasn&#39;t there as the shot came in from PSV I mean as much as PSV have have had load to the ball what have they created possession possession how much purpose is there with that possession they got to keep working hard the boys haven&#39;t they R red by the way Mel such as the cynical world of football sometimes I want to give a big shout out to a great friend of ours Neil kitley of course who sadly lost his job only two League games into the season today at Blackpool and uh crit is a top bloke I know he might even be watching this tonight so if you&#39;re listening we&#39;re all with you at Liverpool we&#39;ll never forget that night you had in front of the cup leading that Liverpool team when Curtis Jones Captain the Reds and we won yeah brilliant absolutely brilliant and yeah I mean a shame cuz only just missed out on the playoffs last season in League one maybe high expectations there beaten heavily at home to Stockport two games in still such a long way to go great coach I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be back in the game soon rer RIT Pennington trying to keep an eye on the turkey under 19 International here Emir land to drive on some clever play this by PSV good defending by pinnington again doesn&#39;t dive in just reading the game well and that&#39;s all that matters sometimes yeah it was congested wasn&#39;t it on the edge of the box there as PSV tried to create an opening but Liverpool defended the Box really well to make sure there was no shot coming in to test m Morrison trying to break away figuroa to applying pressure against Raph van derit couple of EX Liverpool links with tsv Steve one very recently played at the weekend against Z switch you get it too easy for you here&#39;s Michael lafy Kelly oh just played it the wrong side of figuroa he played it in Liverpool might have been in on goal there Tom Hill see what Barry luus is saying there that just that final ball that have been a touch better lipo would have bit in there just to give that little bit of quality when it&#39;s needed that final ball can sometimes be the difference between an attempt or not I&#39;m certainly against a team like this isn&#39;t it difficult of course it&#39;s been difficult this first 20 minutes for the Reds of course Cody gakpo I knew you&#39;d get it he had a terrific Summer by the way he was brilliant wasn&#39;t he for the Netherlands Golden Boot he was tremendous Morrison gliding past opponents this is what he can do on his day the double on him he did a few of them against Manchester City at the weekend Morrison good from Toby fing again good tackle yeah just starts the counter attack doesn&#39;t it from PSV there it didn&#39;t work on that occasion for Morrison but it&#39;s always good to see if we can try and isolate Morrison One V one with the fullback he will make something happen for Liverpool in the final third I had another player lined up for you as well X PS PSV Liverpool sort of my time just after 2005 Champions League I think he arrived in your time yeah would be Yang crom Camp no he was there wasn&#39;t he he come on in the Cup Final the CVG Cup Final Y crom Camp but James Norris with defending to do here against Ty Abed likes to cut inside and he&#39;s found the corner well PSV have been dominant in possession and the Israel youth International Ty Abed plays on that right hand side loves to cut inside on his left and to deadly effect as the opening goal they&#39;ve seen a lot of the ball creating too many opportunities and they&#39;ve got the ball in the back of the net here and of come from nothing he comes inside here you&#39;re thinking we&#39;ve done enough strikes it from outside the penalty area and wasn&#39;t struck with great deal of power just Precision M tried to get there AC Ross to his left hand side it&#39;s just crept in off the post in the end can&#39;t quite manage to get there is the opening goal nice finish wasn&#39;t it to to the Wayside in front here in this group stage first game in the Premier League International cup Michael lafy was fouled there by vessel cun good decision referee we&#39;ll take that one it&#39;s important the boys don&#39;t get down from going to goal behind happy to get that one PSV will be a little bit disappointed because it could have led to another opportunity for them come on let&#39;s get that other player for Liverpool by the way the Evergreen J spearing amongst the Liverpool bench tonight at the tender age of 35 Morrison can he conjure up and equalize it he&#39;s capable of it pilling Hill Kelly getting into a good position here Kyle Kelly first Corner we&#39;ve had opportunity to get players forward decent delivery young boy from Northampton Kyle Kelly came to Liverpool at the age of 13 looking to really push on this season now had a good preseason actually scored a fair few goals for the 18s making some good runs like that into the box yeah good so Tommy pilling with the Liverpool set piece here Norris is forward he got a great header at the weekend James Norris by the way collect his item a beauty but now danger bars offside against aad Deli Thomas yeah regroup well there Liverpool looked it could have been a nervy moment as PSV tried to get forward from our own corner you know one player was going to ask you about meles who we always say with li with the academy if you can&#39;t play for Liverpool then it&#39;s nice to see The Lads going elsewhere and doing really well I think you could include Cameron branagan in that one a lot of you folks will remember him playing under the team under Neil kitley and Michael Beal he&#39;s a big success he&#39;s gone to Oxford United was a major part of them getting promoted and he scored for Oxford on the opening day yeah did he did he score four pens in a game was that scor four p in one game that last season well yeah he&#39;s having a good career for himself absolutely always did well at the Academy didn&#39;t work out at Liverpool for him but yeah I mean Oxford in the championship now and and he&#39;s a big part of that team for them I used to like commentating on Cameron branagan and made up for him it&#39;s great it&#39;s great seeing the lads do well elsewhere and there&#39;s plenty out there having careers for themselves like you say a number of links to back at the Academy and grateful to the coaching they&#39;ve had the time here well look at Liam Miller was excellent last season at Preston he&#39;s back in the championship now with with Hall City yeah and he&#39;s a full International now for Canada yeah yeah there you go I mean had a good chat with Liam and bit frustrated because he wanted to play further up the pitch you know the way that it was with Preston it wasn&#39;t to be but at Hall he may get that opportunity yeah he led the line that night didn&#39;t he we were talk about crit before against rosbury he was up front Miller with Nico Williams at right back who got the assist and another one ni n a premier league regular at nonan Forest doing great there it&#39;s great great to see conod another one yeah he&#39;s injured at the moment I think he he might get a chance under our former coach Stevie Cooper great to see koops out there as well he didn&#39;t get a look in at Leicester last year Connor when he came no back from Everton he Ando Moresco has now gone to Chelsea just didn&#39;t play him but he might get a chance on the CPS Morrison tricky skills it&#39;s done really well battling away real unfortunate there really but now they try and break again the D side Thomas bardi thought that was good from lafy just to get back and help miles otherwise it&#39;s one V one helps his fullback out to make it defens ly more secure Thomas going all the way trying to get away from nallo little bit of a nervy moment I think nallo sort of pulls out with the challenge he recognizes that if he commits himself to it he could be ConEd in a penalty and in the end it was a heavy touch from the PSV front L here we go this one just knows he&#39;s got to pull out of that one do you remember a game we did last season when Liverpool in this competition we played benfica&#39;s B team and that was a good Benfica team they had some good players they were a lot stronger a lot older than what we were and they&#39;ve got a lot of older players than us tonight that is for certain but we we stayed in the game and we got a draw out of it in the end didn&#39;t we yeah McConnell got the goal yeah but but these are good games you know you there&#39;s going to be games where Liverpool dominate the ball yeah that&#39;s a good shout that James McConnell scored and then he he went on to outshine Fernandez and cedo at Wembley love it that was amazing it was a great year wasn&#39;t it for the Academy to see so many get an opportunity I think we thought that would be the case with the Europa League but to see them play in The Cup Final was was incredible and to beat Chelsea like that magnificent Norris can he get a good ball in it&#39;s not bad Figaroa lurking in there it&#39;s not a bad ball Steve he&#39;s put the ball into an area and figeroa was trying to wriggle away from the defender we work the ball out to this left hand side Norris with a delivery he&#39;s capable of puts it into that near post I think he just does enough the defender I think figero is trying to get there Defender does just enough to put him off I&#39;m going to give you one more clue for that PSV X Liverpool player as well he woron a domestic cut with Middlesboro oh wow tremendous SC be B zendon who played in the Champions League final for us though there we go there we go PSV and Liverpool links follow yeah he&#39;s good lad him at Liverpool Bend PSV leading by a goal and threatening to conjure another one up here just got to try and stay in the game and a ball in and the skipper yesper unin on the end of it the 20-year-old who&#39;s got a knife for goal the PSV Skipper there a chance certainly is a chance isn&#39;t it for the front man to double the advantage for PSV finds himself a little bit of space inside the penalty awkward height as the ball comes in slight deflection tries to readjust his body and can&#39;t quite guide It Go bound but found that bit of space inside the area oh re with a gift r and it&#39;s two well he threatened before and a little bit of miscommunication there and an unfortunate Ricochet and the Dutch team take a two-goal lead yeah a little bit fortunate the way it forced him I think the Liverpool players are looking at the lineer to say there was a player offside was he interfering I think that&#39;s why you just got to play to the whistle you can see he looks like he&#39;s stood in an offside position Falls really kindly doesn&#39;t to un necking in the air end and as M comes out tries to make himself nice and big to make the save and of course no f are in these games which we don&#39;t want no no the goal stands too but it comes from the lads trying to play out we give it away in that sort of area and in the end PSV punish us Tommy pilling putting a lot of work in in that Midfield but you can see the way they&#39;ve started they&#39;ve gained confidence you can see why they&#39;ve they&#39;ve had a settled team and they&#39;ve done well PSV in this tournament Crystal Palace who Liverpool beat of course in the end of season playoffs last season beat PSV in the final at s has spark Figaroa trying to work hard up there but goals from TY Abed and yesper unin PSV threatening again but this time Cornell mcure gets across yeah I think one thing we found difficult in the opening half an hour with this game obviously with two goals behind PSV have seen majority if not all the ball just creating chances you know to cause problems for that PSV defense the only one I can think of is what was a big moment in the game fourth minute could it have been a red card should it have been a red card sometimes you need that little bit of look big decisions going your way it&#39;s gone against Liverpool but we haven&#39;t really offered a great deal in the final third to really trouble PSV here they come again Thomas nalo is there lafy made the challenge Brasa Abed Panda black and conter pinnington the 17y old has been at the club since under seven level young boy from bebington in will who did so well moving up to the 21s last season yeah real test test for the boys isn&#39;t it you know found it difficult this first half two goals behind difficult out there but this is where the mentality is staying the game just stay in the game bressa vit There&#39;s Tom Hill back defending for Liverpool by the way of a big birthday shout from an academy regular tonight Andy Kelly it&#39;s his birthday happy birthday guess where he is he&#39;s not in the pub he&#39;s not in a restaurant he&#39;s here watching the Reds yeah like a good red P was a second choice Academy was the first absolutely or Melwood yeah vessel could to Thomas and a real test for Terrence miles very direct and Pacey take go land got to be careful not to get overrun a bit here haven&#39;t they I think that&#39;s frustration yeah I think pilling just sort of knowing what he&#39;s doing there Liverpool not seeing much of the ball and in the end just committing the free kick I think maybe a bit fortunate it would just be a word from the referee rather than anything else long way out so Isaac badi the Dutch under 18 International and a big gap opens up again here basadi chance spars good save by Cornell MC yeah has to make the save what was a free kick for Liverpool in the buildup that&#39;s how PSV won the ball back break very quickly now Teo land that easily could have been 3-0 but Liverpool&#39;s young goalkeeper did well Neil M yeah I just wondered if this was a foul or not miles plays the ball up and you can see the defender comes right through I think it&#39;s laffy isn&#39;t it he was asking the question good movement gets away from pinnington there towards the far corner it&#39;s a good save in the end from Mishu to stop PSV going 3-0 up Kelly Pennington Hill ping good pressing by lafy and again Michael lafy brilliant play by the young man Figaroa great play from lafa you have to say the determination to win the ball win the tackle I&#39;m not sure the ball was meant for Figaroa I think he was looking for Kelly on that far post wonder if there was maybe a shout towards Figaro he wasn&#39;t sure what was behind him but that was great determination wasn&#39;t it there we go put them under a little bit of pressure forc the mistake wins the first one fully committed for the next one heads up he can see somebody&#39;s in a better position Ferell trying to take the touch I think it was Kelly just behind him he may have been in that better position ping you have to say as well at times PSV I can hear Barry Lut getting frustrated on the bench with Jay spearing they&#39;ve been quite cynical when Liverpool have tried to get counterattacks going yeah and again it&#39;s that sort of little bit more experience you know a number of these players play in a competitive league the Dutch was it the second division what whatever they call it over there where they play the B Teams right the reserve team football and they get into play against senior players and they&#39;re getting that experience that sort of because they call it PSV young don&#39;t they which basically basically defined as their second team yeah they&#39;re beating but but predominantly a lot of young players with maybe one or two of the older Lads and a lot of these Lads will play in that team so T go land get a yellow card for that challenge Kelly that&#39;s a nice reverse pass bars there Abed who got the first goal nalo to the rescue was on the bench for the first team in that FA Cup night against Southampton at anfield last season when L kumas scored Dany got two Tron come on his debut what a night that was amazing I mean Southampton got promoted in the end real strong side in the championship to perform the way the young Lads did was was magnificent so good was it proud night for everybody involved at the Academy yeah I won&#39;t forget that for a while it was great to see pilling qass is in the championship Now isn&#39;t he un loan at Stoke of course nice play there Terrence miles Liverpool trying to win a corner good overlap play there from Miles yeah it well down the right hand side miles and Morrison little bit of combination play now 19 Terrence miles is the nephew of a former Liverpool forward at the Academy John Miles who now takes our under 11s there he was a year older than me what a good attacking player miles he was really good player Kieran Morrison to swing the corner in good ball actually and Sheiks did well ping couldn&#39;t get the range but it goes down as our first chance only chance of the first half ball comes to the edge of the penalty area it&#39;s a decent first touch because he sets himself for the shot lingers first Contact is the goalkeepers nice first touch can he hit the target just over the top so five minutes to the break ludes new his team were in for a tough test tonight this is a good PSV side as I say they&#39;ve been together for a a good while now this team and you can and you can tell that yeah yeah you can see and yes it&#39;s under 21s but you do have to remind yourself just how young this group is for Liverpool and how many players could potentially play you know the windows open mentioned about a few who may well get low moves who would have been out there tonight and certainly caused PSV a few more problems yeah I think it&#39;s fair to say after the window shuts next next week that Barry lutus will have a fair idea what the majority of his under 21 score is going to be between now and January that&#39;s one of the challenges he has isn&#39;t it you know who who he has available for the game who needs minutes you know a lot of competition for the players cuz again we&#39;re in the Bristol Street Motors trophy got a crew Alexandra away the first game next week we&#39;re also in a group with Blackpool and harut town Kyle Kelly getting a yellow card for Liverpool yeah it&#39;s a good it&#39;s a good comp by by the way we&#39;ve not entered that other competition where teams could AC Cadabby teams are going to compete with non- League teams so we&#39;ve not entered that one okay but but the efl trophy it&#39;s great to see The Lads win last season what was it moram away that was a good one two that was a good one 3-0 really good first win first win in that competition yeah Everton 21&#39;s beat tramier last night did you see that one one one down they were won 3-1 United with two- n down at barnesley they won 3-2 let&#39;s hope the lads can can get a victory or two this year is it yeah good test good examinations different styles senior players anen nallo with a strong challenge nallo to the rescue senior players who will not want to get beat to 121 now vereit Thomas play Black pool in it last year didn&#39;t we it was was it 5-2 big win in the end yeah black scor three late goals yeah 85 minutes flatter than the score line flatter them yeah yeah never a 52 game that lafy chasing further forward for Liverpool here Norris with the header Hill well after I said about the PSV goalkeeper Age Jack he&#39;s not touched it since has he he&#39;s been very quiet this first half lafy comes in with a challenge again was talk about another Liverpool player had some injury problems Oakley Canon real shame for Oaks was a good lad open he can get back fit and show what he can do it&#39;d be a real asset for Barry lucus to have available in the squad we&#39;ve seen he can score goals it&#39;s quick as ever when a player has some injury problems he just HED they can get Beyond it and get back again yeah and we wish him all the best yeah absolutely like you say he&#39;s he&#39;s quick player can be the difference in any game knows where the back of the net is had a good goal scoring record Tom Hill good kick actually to pick out the Run of Norris now Kyle Kelly in a bit of space did well they made some good forward r playing in a a pretty unfamiliar position Kyle Kelly yeah he&#39;s won another set piece for Liverpool gives an opportunity to try and get a goal back and finish the half strongly so closing in on half time on the likes of a Carter Pennington nallo Norris as we said is good in the air from these deliveries pilling produce a good one been a tough old half mels hasn&#39;t it in in truth yeah yeah it has you know we were full of confidence and enjoyed the victory against City at the weekend beating them 3-1 at this level played very well as well some good goals but we knew it was going to be difficult PSV a lot older than our group out there and it has been the case this first half only one minute I&#39;ve added on time at the end of the half in the opening game of the Premier League International cup for Liverpool as I say also in the group Hera from Berlin in Germany of course Sparta Prague and Nord charland so some good different opposition for the boys to play against and if not maybe the toughest to start with you mentioned about PSV they&#39;re in the final last year final the year before we need to be strong certainly are at 21&#39;s level a tough opening game for the lads but there&#39;ll be a team talk at halim and hopefully we can we can see a little bit more going forward in in the final third to try and cause PSV some problems so the halftime whistle has gone then here at the Kirby Academy and it&#39;s been a tough half no doubt about that as far as Liverpool are concerned trailing 2-0 to a a very good PSV einhoven second team Tai Abed the young Israeli cutting inside onto his favored left foot to score the opener and then after a a bit of a deflection in the end yes but unen grab through to score and make it two Cornell M making a good save to stop it going to 3-0 but Liverpool had a big chance themselves early doors when Kyle Kelly looked like he was clean through he was fouled nothing was given Fine Lines small margins in these games isn&#39;t it but Hal time here at the Kirby Academy it is Liverpool nil PSV 2 [Music] a moment to save for any play royal highers princess an and the cup belongs to Liverpool in preseason CA your together for so long people turn rless J is a horrible man when it comes to fight how did it feel was going to and then winning the trophy honestly I was so scared cuz everyone just kept scoring and I thought oh no you were asking me that I could play you even more but um I will say you were not fully feed there was a pair of football boots on the side they were Kenny&#39;s and he said to me you can have them put that Jersey on with the history of the of that Jersey and the players that wore before me you it was great it was such a bad injury that the doctor thought I wouldn&#39;t play again I knew I wouldn&#39;t be the same player I was in terms of a flying wing and doing all the great things the judge goes from senten to 90 days and yeah I thought that&#39;s it time of liver&#39;s over I didn&#39;t have any money you know Queen Park were paying me 18 qu a week but you know I enjoyed it is there something you can tell us about that final that we don&#39;t know I have seen a lot of lies nunz is away and he&#39;s got support as well from s [Applause] slidez who wins the ball back fairly for now according to Simon Hooper has found Sly who finishes the game off such a big important player for Liverpool Liverpool 1st of September 1892 the beginning of the football season everyone&#39;s at the new built goodison Park but one man is notably absent today John holding anfield landlord Brewer businessman and now ex president of Everton FC puts his reputation on the line in a local house in a makeshift changing room his new team prepares assembled in weeks their holding&#39;s greatest gamble Liverpool Football Club defiant in blue and white white takes to the pitch for the first time with not even a 100 people watching Liverpool choose to attack the anfield road end holding ceremoniously kicks off and he&#39;s barely left the pitch when loudmouth Miller scores the club&#39;s first ever goal no one expected that but this is a team of scotsmen chosen for their Mastery of the ball Captain Andy Hannah former Everton Skipper and master tactician Marshal&#39;s men James McBride Tiny But Nimble is a Blair at right back funny man Maly mcvine dances across center field Duncan the wall McLean stops rotheram Town dead the team of Max Thunders to a S1 Victory holding&#39;s bold as Venture is paying off beautifully and the rest well it&#39;s history what a touch by lean K and by the way this K it&#39;s lean Kanan Sophie Roman Hall in the center can she find her she can she gets the goal Sophie r h she that is the icing on the cake [Music] good PV have they have looked quality te yeah absolutely it was a difficult first half for the young Reds I think you would say perhaps they were clinical they didn&#39;t create loads of chances they saw lots and lots of the ball and it was frustrating for Liverpool because we didn&#39;t see a great deal of it and didn&#39;t have too many chances ourselves so PSV very much in control of that first half and I guess a bit of a talking point as far as Barry lutus would be concerned is that nil nil Kyle Kelly looks to be going clean through he&#39;s clipped nothing given massive moment in the game yeah it was very early on in the opening five minutes of the game but sometimes you need that little bit of look where the big decisions go your way and it didn&#39;t for Liverpool massive moment it could quite easily have been a red card I thought at the time the initial Instinct was red card the referee I don&#39;t think the referee saw it I&#39;m not too sure his position was too good and he didn&#39;t see it couldn&#39;t give it had he have seen it I think the PSV Defender was in trouble I think that would have been a red card and as good as it&#39; been first playing with 10 men would would maybe not have shown as much control as what we did see from them so then let&#39;s have a look back at the goals as they went in I mean PSV as you might imagine for a European team coming here to play against Liverpool that they&#39;re very good at keeping the ball and and good buildup Play It&#39;s Ty Abed the Young Israel youth International with the goal this is what he likes doing onto that left foot yeah yeah he&#39;s cut in from that right hand side and as the Liverpool Defenders have have tried to get back def defensively into the penalty area he&#39;s just comeing to the space he&#39;s just hoping that perhaps there&#39;ll be a defensive Midfield player coming back to support the defense there isn&#39;t and that allows him to get the shot away he hasn&#39;t Struck it with great deal of pace but what he has done is precision found it right in the corner it&#39;s come off the post MCU at full stretch can&#39;t quite get there and that was the opening goal and it has to be said a Liverpool Team without a number of regulars who might have played tonight the likes of Tren K Dey Isaac M are battling the way back from from injury of course they are both running again the likes of Josh Davidson Jaden Dans Oakley caner they all remain on the sidelines and are not available there&#39;s a few other players who might have played we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen to them in terms of loans between now and the end of the window so Barry luus is a little bit restricted in terms of his Squad I mean young train only is training with the first team it&#39;s such a bright Talent isn&#39;t he and I&#39;m certain he&#39;ll probably get some more game time for the 21 as the season goes on but then just when Liverpool were hoping in this one to stay in the game then a bit of a wicked deflection and they went two- n up yesper unen got the goal yeah it was fortunate the way it did for to him Liverpool looking to play out from the back and you know if you are going to look to play out from here there are going to be errors at times and unfortunately for Liverpool it was on this occasion know intercepted here we give the ball away question marks was the PSV attacker in an offside position did it affect the Defenders we&#39;re not sure but you know that slight moment of switching off the striker didn&#39;t he was alert or Neen and took it away nicely as M came out to try and make himself big actually got a hand to it nearly saved it but in the end it was a clinical finish from the front man to make it 2-n but I think as as you said before meles it&#39;s a difficult game it&#39;s a good team this who&#39;ve got good pedigree in this competition they won it the year before beaten finalists last year so you know what you&#39;re up against it&#39;s a good experience for some of these young Lads I mean the Kell Figaroa Kyle Kelly both making their first starts for the 21s in this game against a team like this is an invaluable experience isn&#39;t it good and bad yeah absolutely I mean ultimately it&#39;s about learning it&#39;s about developing and and if you&#39;re playing against older Lads a little bit more experienced you know you can you can certainly learn a great deal yeah we just see here Welly lucky will be very much part of the 21s this season great to see Lee Jonas back the 20-year-old scouser of course after his injury problems I&#39;m hoping he can again have a an injury free run now yeah they played it the weekend didn&#39;t they earn that really good win for the 21 so as much as tonight&#39;s been a disappointing first half it was a great start to the season you know in Premier League to to beat Manchester City and obviously Jonas who&#39;s had his own injury problems himself great to see him playing that that game yeah ryel young as well he played as a number nine at the weekend he&#39;ll step up from the under 18 to the 21s he missed a lot of football last year through injury so for him it&#39;s a bit of a fresh start again stepping up at this level yeah and we may see a couple of them on second half and the wand he&#39;s one of our favorites Dominic cores who scored a great goal at the weekend now 21 the scouser as I say had a loan very successful loan did well actually played a number of games got a few assists there in the Swiss Super League with Jen Sportland year yeah fair play I mean it was quite an unusual Alan you fair play it&#39;s a brave move to go to a country a league that perhaps not many of us are that aware of so he said he loved it and asked him fair play you know he&#39;s gone there and and made it a success done well at the weekend a goal and assist he&#39;s on the bench tonight I think we&#39;ll see him at some point again he&#39;ll be in that bracket won&#39;t he a number of players this window that that may well go out Al loan and experience more senior football don&#39;t forget folks more live football coming your way don&#39;t forget all more live football more than ever before this season stick with us here on LFC TV go and across all of our platforms bringing your live football marbridge Wilkinson&#39;s under 18s play their first home game this Saturday they take on Middlesboro kickoff is 12:30 join us at 12:25 this Saturday lunchtime for some lunchtime football we&#39;ve seen a few boys of course who made the Step Up from the under 16 team quite early last year to play for the 18s it was a tough opening day for them tough defeat against Derby but hopefully the boys can bounce back on home soil this weekend I remember the game against middles BR on the back pitch at the Academy last season Kieran Morrison got a hattrick scored two absolute net Busters with that left foot in a win 3-1 got a hatrick yeah yeah yeah great season great season for him and I think what you found with the under 18s a number of players who could have featured ended up progressing very quickly you know I think of the likes of kumas and and Dan you know who who could have probably got 40 goals from last season if he stayed in that level Jad and Dan started last season with ls kumas in the under 18s team yeah and then forward to February in the they&#39;re in the the squad in wembling well they were both scored in the first team last seas that doesn&#39;t happen no that much these days but but to score as well in that FA Cup game against Southampton absolutely incredible you know the the speed of the development they were ready and and did very well but the reality is D&#39;s now obviously suffered an injury kumas is out on loan you they had great highs last season and it&#39;s how they sort of can they can they get there again a little bit of a a step backwards with an injury and alone but then can they can they get there again I mean with young Jayden Dans he&#39;s got time on his side he&#39;s only he only just turned 18 at the stter this year so he&#39;s still young and he&#39;s just got a bit of a back problem but some young players experience back problems growing growing up M CVG had his first sh of back problems well well in my first year at Liverpool when I was 16 and I signed on I was out for seven months and what you would say is just listen to what the physios and the medical Department say you&#39;re desperate to get back course you are you&#39;re young player you want to be out there playing I&#39;m sure Dani will be the same just listen to what the medical Department have to say because it will help him for longevity in the game so he&#39;s not breaking down when he comes back so if it is three months two months whatever it may be four months he&#39;s just got to do the right things no shortcuts and he&#39;ll come back about playing them tell you what folks in terms of the future&#39;s bright I was at the Academy last week for the under 15 merys side International cup it was a great tournament teams from all over the world and included in that in the group stage a Liverpool under 15 team beat bcia Dortmund twice brilliant yeah well and and I tell you what we&#39;ve got two Wingers in that team not going to name names for obvious reasons just yet because they&#39;re they&#39;re young they&#39;re under 15 players but the two of the quickest Lads that I&#39;ve seen at the Academy in a long long time unbel it&#39;s they&#39;re exciting to watch so going to keep an eye on their progress and uh you never know what what could happen and a lot of young players there&#39;s a few under 15 under 16 players who played for the 18s last season so the key is and Mark Bridge Wilkinson the 18s boss Alex Engle Thor our Academy director always says to these players on the the training ground be ready yeah no matter what you ready well there&#39;s a lot of exciting Talent we know that and what you would say is there is a pathway at Liverpool we&#39;ve seen young players get that opportunity great things going on at the Academy starting obviously at the top with Alex inle Thorp so many great coaching staff around him to help nurture and develop these young players I mean there&#39;s no doubt about it at all last year it was an a truly incredible year for the Academy from all the staff and the players everybody connected with the academy that day at wemy was was special it doesn&#39;t happen that often it really doesn&#39;t I when you go back to your day there&#39;s one or two players that you played with we talk about now we feel could have played for Liverpool just didn&#39;t get that opportunity at the time for whatever reason you know but with Jurgen going it&#39;s a new era under our new head coach on a slot and in many ways it starts again for these young players and you&#39;ve got to keep on impressing yeah absolutely a clean slates in many ways yeah and you know they keep impressing the manager the coaching St they just can&#39;t ignore if you are regularly consistently working hard on the training pitch showing you can cope around some of the senior players and when you get the game time whether it be 21s 19s UFA Youth League whatever it may be you&#39;re out there showing the right sort of attitude and trying to contribute to the game and being the player who really does stand out I mean for example Trey neon at the moment who is training with the first team squad we saw him in America impressed on a lot when he we saw him in that end of season season playoff game against Tottenham and Tottenham had some experienced players out there he was he stood up at the age of 16 then before he turned 17 and the Su and he was one of the best players on that pitch that day wasn&#39;t he yeah that offers encouragement for the future a lot of excitement around him it&#39;s about the mental side of things a lot as well you know keeping his feet on the ground and he&#39;s around the first te he went to Portman Road around the first te experiencing the match day the first premier league game of the season okay didn&#39;t get on the pitch or or be be there in terms of on there but he&#39;s part of it you know really did impress him preseason as Liverpool get ready to come out there for the second half in front of a couple of merys side celebrities legendary local photographers Nick Taylor the academy photographer and Mr propaganda himself Dave Dave rawcliffe that&#39;s his company name by the way yeah good Snappers think he&#39;s been there a long time oh i&#39; I&#39;ve got pictures for me playing from Nick great pictures by the way hope he give you them for [Laughter] free so Liverpool back out then for the second half here and PSV leading 2-0 but again as we always say folks these are great tests examinations playing against teams like like this you&#39;ve got to keep cool heads in these situations can this Liverpool team get the next goal I&#39;m sure the likes of Barry lutus and Chas spearing would have said to the boys look stay in it can you get the next goal there&#39;s been one or two half opportunities which might have produced something for us well they ask in the game at 2-0 absolutely you know the next goal will change the momentum of the game how will PSV react you know maybe if they are a little bit complacent thinking it&#39;s a little bit too easy then we can turn the momentum of this game our way a but straight away they&#39;ve got a man over here that&#39;s bardi breaking through Midfield Thomas in the penalty area got to be careful here lafy did really well takes control of the situation then mcor grabs the loose one immediately on the attack W the PSV there just wondered was it the right ball the weighted ball out to that left hand side didn&#39;t make the most what looked to promise an attack for them came in for Mandy Robertson&#39;s old Club Cornell mcore at the start of last season from Hall City what a bite that was oh amazing incredible what was it 68 million quid under 10 million pounds to get what proved to be one of the best left backs in World football laf and Figaroa pressing there Vander black covering there James Norris now 21 scouser Tom Hill trying to break away this is good for Tom Hill you know it&#39;s a big step that for him he&#39;s not done that for quite a while playing on Saturday and then playing a few days later in the midweek so for his Fitness he&#39;s taken a massive step tonight and I just hope he can get through it okay I wonder if he&#39;ll get the full game or or maybe he&#39;ll have to go off at some point in this second half vessel Kun Thomas now Figaroa can he break he&#39;s been fouled but Tom Hill might get in there till and the goalkeeper saves at his feet good Advantage by the referees a couple of cynical fouls by the PSV players again but Tom Hill was nearly it yeah I think PSV wanted one initially didn&#39;t give it think we wanted one which wasn&#39;t given and was it just a heavy touch in the end from Tom Hill otherwise he could have been in on goal that&#39;s typical Tom Hill run isn&#39;t it driving in getting on the end of things good covering there by nallo good defending by Terren miles under pressure from Thomas I just wondered as well with Tom Hill was there a slight nudge this was the first one for the free kick is it a foul not sure that&#39;s a foul but because Tom Hills in oh I just wondered was there any kind of contact there and maybe not enough maybe he expected it have to say the goalkeeper was off his line very quickly nallo you have to say that Liverpool under 21&#39;s head coach Barry lutus does a terrific job you know he always gets the best out of the players again from one game to the next you know he&#39;s got to make numerous changes five changes today already straight into the season he does a great job getting the best out of these players and here Figaro nice charging through Midfield Tom Hill Morrison towards Figaroa yeah bright play from Liverpool really well it&#39;s good to see the red shirts pouring forward to try and get on the end of this attack it starts with the goalkeeper good play from ping really good ball forward wasn&#39;t it nice little layoff in Midfield there driving run from from Tom Hill just that final ball coming in in the end a little bit too inviting for the goalkeeper now Thomas on the counter for PSV babadi still babadi unin peing back at him Kyle Kelly trying to push on abade a lovely skill by bars the Turkish player [Music] badi and again and it&#39;s three Isaac babadi finishes it off after the initial save by Cornell MCU to make it 3-0 to PSV unfortunate because of the way Liverpool had started the second half brightly yeah know now to PS3 I thought he should have scored a little bit earlier in the buildup we missed the tackle there on the edge of the the penalty area I thought he took too long there it&#39;s a good save just gets away from M scur as he tries to reclaim it in the end the momentum of bad takes him into the path of the ball and he finishes it with an empty goal in the end I think you got win tackles there losing tackles in that area allows him to drive at the towards the goal in the end he does get a bit fortunate the way he comes back to him should have scored before it m makes a good save he gets a second chance to put it away F trying to charge forward Kelly supporting him scale again good tackle by Carter pinnington Hill Kelly he got to keep at it mes haven&#39;t they yeah absolutely you get these nights occasionally games during your career where it really is difficult keep your head keep doing the right things keep working hard and now the fell scored the first goal Ty Abed just a bit too far for Thomas he&#39;ll continue the Run badi almost gate and Kiera Morrison left a frustrated young man as&#39;s PSV got the set piece yeah yeah I think one thing you look at when the score is like this and it&#39;s not your night don&#39;t don&#39;t want to see any of the lads feeling sorry for themselves none of the head they got to keep going got to keep going doing it for themselves doing it for them for the team sometimes learn a little bit about yourself as a player when things aren&#39;t going your way so I was frustrated and disappointed as they are just got to keep the heads together and make sure it doesn&#39;t get any worse ore at the back post onen well fortunate he had a poor first touch because if he has a decent first touch the space he has that could well be four nil he work it well to the far post the space he has at the far post no Liverpool shirt anywhere near him it&#39;s a poor first touch a decent touch and I think he gets A Better Effort at goal it bounces up it hits him on the chest then we can try and put him under pressure gets the Finish wrong Mallo thomasin I just wonder if jce ber might be tempted to get out there just to help some of the young Lads when when it&#39;s when when they need that sort of leader out there that little bit of experience attempt from PSV it&#39;s blocked isn&#39;t it behind for the corner so the turkey under 19 International Emy abaz to float one in Wicked deflection in there and Amara nalo got it away it&#39;s got back to bars again nalo again with a telling touch Thomas good challenge from ping Figaroa Morrison might get there you know here is the Northern Ireland under 19 International Morrison Hill can he get a shot away Tom Hill good try yeah well done Morrison you know he wasn&#39;t favorite to win the ball but he he made it his own Liverpool breaking using the pace he has on the counter attack King wins The Tackle in the end nice little ball out in the end to Morrison and he does really well you know cuz he&#39;s one V one with the defender he&#39;s waiting for the support he needs support to get up there eventually it arrives makes it out to Tom Hill an effort at goal don&#39;t trouble the goalkeeper but nice to see an effort going in at goal and it&#39;s also good from Hill from a fitness level&#39;s perspective he spoke about that before he was at right back when that move materialized and the next thing he nearly ends up on the end of it yeah Ty AB again clever trickery here from the dir [Music] side T land I think that&#39;s one of the big differences with English football and football these Dutch Lads don&#39;t need to go out on loan because they&#39;re playing in the second tier of Dutch Football aren&#39;t they so so that&#39;s where they&#39;re getting their experience against senior players against some of the other B Teams as well whereas a lot of the the younger Lads in English teams Liverpool big teams as well like City United Chelsea The Lads will go out and loan to get experience that first football because it&#39;s not quite the same level as of playing 21s what the PSB boys are playing in in their Dutch League yeah because we&#39;ve had some really good results in this competition the past few years with stronger under 21 teams of played remember Liverpool beat you know Paris sanj here Billy Cho scored from the halfway line yeah for the wonder goal the goalkeeper Billy K go to where was he D gone to Scotland on a permanent deal so we wish Billy Kay all the best there by the way it could be a little bit Moody between him and Stevenson this year dund d dund d United I don&#39;t know if they play each other or not yeah Lucas Stevenson got yeah got on loan a big garby game up there yeah wish lcer all the best there did well on loan at Barrow last year did well in preseason too so good move for him get some more experience I&#39;ve got poor knowledge of the Scottish Lees I&#39;m hoping in the same league so they can have a battle there I&#39;m not sure norish forg against V back in 2007 remember Stevie G became Liverpool&#39;s leading scorer in European Cup competition that night since been overtaken by the Egyptian king Muhammad Salah but he he got a beauty a Steve Finn and cross and oven for that one but there&#39;s PSV threatening another one here with Abed badi good challenge from pilling he&#39;s got to keep working hard the young Liverpool team here tring to get goal side of nallo and pinnington to the rescue pinnington again Skil by the center back Bessa and again the center back is got on the end of a move he started himself yeah yeah comfortable the end but you can see the importance if you give the ball away you have to look after the ball cuz it&#39;s coming straight back PSV winning the ball back in a good area create that opportunity try to Loop it over mour in the end moves his feet nicely to make the save looking forward to Sunday mes you&#39;ll be there for us yeah it&#39;s not first home game of the season the best proper game on the F slaugh at anfield is there anyways yeah it was nice to be there for the Sevilla game but I think it an even better atmosphere I think everyone will all be up for it great start to beat ipwi as well anfield was a fortunate last season the only game we lost was Palace and how we lost that that game I&#39;ll never know 5161 would have been a more accurate score line with how we played that day Vander black took his eye off the ball momentarily gets it back again does Thomas to town on Sunday with without e Anon look like it won&#39;t he won&#39;t be bars mcure did well yeah Fabio carvalo come off the bench at the weekend against Palace made his debut did we put it in the deal that he can&#39;t play probably good win for them though they had a big decision I don&#39;t know if you saw it or not the palace that was ridiculous I felt for as as a free kick that was crazy that good old V&#39;s back isn&#39;t it V couldn&#39;t even get involved refle a little bit too early we had one ourselves if you remember first half Burns should have had a second yellow at nil nil yeah thought he was lucky the point it&#39;s back isn&#39;t it the Premier League&#39;s back we love it it is talking points Gore absolutely Thomas showing a clean pair of heels to Miles look at him go he&#39;s like lightning brilliant save Cornell missu yeah it needed to be a real individual skill from that left hand side from Thomas gliding past a couple of Liverpool players making it look effortless in the end it&#39;s a good save from M so Liverpool getting ready to make a first change ranell Jung the 18-year-old who led the line at the weekend is going to come on PSV are going to make a change themselves as well double change PSV Dante Gilbert who&#39;s from Trinidad and Tobago he&#39;s going to come on if they can get the scoreboard working and Javon Simons who came from na bada so they&#39;re going to take off em bar who&#39;s had a good game the young turkey youth International in that number 10 role taking 11 off Thomas as well nearly scored an absolute worldy with his last touch yeah so that&#39;s the changes so Liverpool going to bring on ryell young who came to the club as an Under 12 from Huddersfield and an injury hit last season one of his highlights was coming off the bench and scoring an absolute Wy for the under 18s in a draw with Everton at Finch Farm ran all the way from his own half and scored meanwhile a corner to PSV substitution to play and header oh and it&#39;s a own goal On&#39;s header and right on the goal line it looked as if it was going to be cleared but unfortunately Is It Michael lafy Neil M not sure who got the Final Touch whether it was going in or not from the set piece well NECA will claim it no doubt about that to try and get his second goal of the game Wonder was it going in and Liverpool tried to clear it off the line by the way it&#39;s 40 yeah it looks like Liverpool going to take off krol Figaroa here and bring on ryell Young and Jay bearing G to come on for Tom Hill I think because of minutes this really with Tom Hill good to see him back Lee Jonas on for James Norris and Dominic cores also going to come on for Liverpool in place of Tommy King so those changes have been made we will have another look back at the that goal for you just to clear up the goal scorer so the changes have been made there for Liverpool good to see the wand back out there Dominic cores here&#39;s the corner I think it is Laffy you see lafie&#39;s number eight there is on the goal line here&#39;s the header here laffy sticks out of boot he&#39;s trying to clear it away I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going in it&#39;s just an unfortunate error yeah and it&#39;s an own goal by Michael leffy yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s not going it&#39;s a own goal but what you would say is why is nobody challenging the first head you know as much as people might say he should clear it maybe he should deal with it we need to challenge that first header when the cross comes in like that has to be more wanting to win that first Contact it was a free header now they&#39;re Break It Forward again leading 4-0 Jay bearing there at the tender age of 35 still loves playing on the training ground with the players every day with his experience some fresh legs on the experience as well Dominick coru 21 at Liverpool&#39;s Academy since the age of five fresh legs with ranel young coming on as well great to see Lee Jonas back out there the scous are after his y problems I think set pieces Liverpool have conceded a set piece there so important in for these young players to learn and that&#39;s what what it is learning from from those sort of things now ranel young with an opportunity to run at them just a heavy Touch by the way mels there&#39;s no way I could talk about that own goal I I I fully sympathize with Michael lafy there I scored an own goal like that playing for a Sunday League team in Wallace years ago it happens yeah it happens he&#39;ll be gutted course he will he trying to clear it with the wrong foot on it just ends up going into the net it&#39;s one of them in it even some of the best defenders in in the world score own goals ask Cara if he&#39;s watching only J it&#39;s good to see Jay snapping into tackles is it yeah absolutely still looking well still looking fair and again I think he&#39;s a big influence out there not just in games like this but in the dressing room but also every day in the on the training pitch you know helping these young players learn develop as they as they hope to have careers at Liverpool and in the game themselves here&#39;s Kelly and ryell young is in behind him here now what can Liverpool do here Young good stop Jung again Kelly Liverpool easily could have scored there ranel young The Substitute was a save at the near post Kelly had a great pass didn&#39;t he in the path of young it was a tight angle it was good play from Liverpool winning the ball back getting it forward and in the end getting attempt at goal remember the uh game against we played Monaco here in this competition last season and Jaden Dan scored his first goal for the 21s and then had a controversial equalizer ruled out in stoppage time I think it was cores who won the ball initially winning it well there good made himself look big there the goalkeeper next shiks did well good play there per ryell young though Lively yeah it was and a good pass as well from BR Kelly in behind to see the Run of young yeah I know he did a really good unselfish job for the team young at the weekend due to unavailability Barry luus had no choice but to play him as a number nine we&#39;ve seen him in the past he&#39;s a Winger but he did well lead in the line and and played well here&#39;s cores scored and grabbed an assist that was that trusty left P yeah yeah a little bit more energy out there from Liverpool from the subs as I say folks still got to play hura from Berlin Sparta Prague and naland in this competition so Liverpool&#39;s hopes of qualifying out of this group stage despite the score line still very much alive and timing as well you know PSV have come here with a strong lineup wed to win the game and the timing for us for this game is we&#39;re not sure what&#39;s happening with a lot of the young players I mean and you saying further down the line Liverpool could play one of these other teams in the group and have a much stronger on the 21s team yeah this is my point about the timeing we&#39;re not sure what&#39;s going on with these young players availability for Barry lutus you know who can play for him who&#39;s going out on loan those sort of things who&#39;s injured at the moment nice scale by Kieran Morrison lafy spearing Kelly When preparing for this game Steve I was thinking okay PSV if they had some of the great players of PSV back in the day here&#39;s one for you they&#39;ve had one of the best strik to have ever played the game that played for PSV wow you think of him there they go again trying to get another goal played wide towards Vander black Brazilian Brazilian one of the best strikers have a guess I&#39;ll have a guess at this one roario he better than Romario Romario was the top CER for this lad was better he was all right this lad was better wow went to maybe Barcelona afterwards Brazilian he had too many injuries but when you talk about some of the best strikers in World football he played for PSV when he was absolutely unbelievable Vander black it&#39;s not vanoy vanoy did play for PSV yeah he&#39;s I wasn&#39;t going to pick up my X-man Eric ten hard&#39;s assistant now is he yeah he is that&#39;s all next away game isn&#39;t it yeah before the international break would you another International break already three games in already right this Brazilian Striker let&#39;s get back to him PSV Barcelona Brazilian had had injuries that sort of ciled how good he could have been was Top Notch though top notch what the Brazilian Ronaldo yes it was him wow yes what a striker he was he was superb like dsv yeah I liked him yeah SC some unbelievable goals of course his mate Rivaldo played in that game that you were famous for olympios and he scored pass Kirky pass Kirky yeah you still say Kirk should have saved no absolutely not it it was the whoever was in the wall should have done the job I mean Ral ralo might have even won a Balon or you know but for me reene Ronaldo the original was was incredible now spearing just a heavy touch and here they come again Cornell mcor is there to grabb the loose ball great to see Jay spearing playing European football again for liverpools I remember Jay coming on in that unbelievable night against Real Madrid when desna scored in that one 4 Jakob on he was brilliant when he the reception he got was brilliant brilant some result wasn&#39;t it Real Madrid 40 at it&#39;s the same weak as the 41 at Old Trafford that you know that was unbelievable Stevie G and Torres were Unstoppable 4-1 old traff was great Fabio Aurelio&#39;s free kick wow we&#39;d take that again w we yeah should have been 4-1 last year just didn&#39;t take our chances they&#39;d be the two- two in the end Andre we put five past them at Old Trafford a few years ago didn&#39;t yeah the sell hatrick yeah and seven at anfield don&#39;t forget I think is he the only player to have scored a hat trick in the Premier League at Old traffic I think he might be yeah unbelievable looked sharp last weekend he against di real good sign new premier league record as well see Jamie vardy got leveled the others by the way he got eight he&#39;s on eight now as well he&#39;s scored for Lester okay he&#39;s 37 yeah surely he&#39;s not going to level Salah next year if leester good run this by Lee Jonas Kelly the boys playing for pride but heads aren&#39;t going down Jay sping will make sure that won&#39;t be the case good ball good run by Morrison from cor&#39;s pass spearing Jung still ryell Yung cores they&#39;re keeping they keeping at it the boys yeah they are yeah I think the subs have helped in terms of energy a little bit of aggression out there wanting to win the tackle and making sure that as hurtful as it is at 4-0 it doesn&#39;t get any worse than this a frustrating night for Carter pinnington and the boys but as I said this is a good PSV team that come up against they play in a player League the Liverpool playing Premier League 2 level they&#39;ve played together for quite a while now the the players we&#39;ve had one of two little moments bit unfortunate not to maybe have scored a goal tonight as well yeah I think maybe the closest hill shot was over Jungs was saved I know I&#39;m clutching at straws but I&#39;m always going to do AR I but that early opportunity at nil nil when you felt could have been a a decision taken by the ref there and it would have been a red card because it was last man another day Kelly another day yeah I I just don&#39;t think they ref seeing it no I I agree maybe the Lino could have helped him down down this side if you saw it as well I&#39;m not sure sometimes you you need the big decisions to go your way and obviously we knew it was going to be a difficult night anyway it&#39;s proved to be the case tyed got the opener yeser onen made it to then after a good start to the second half five minutes in Isaac the baddy made it three and then a rather unfortunate goal from a set piece and Micha lafy on the line turned it into his own net Enzo GS coming on now for Michael Bret the Belgian under 18 International began his youth career at meckelin comes on and again their entire team and most of their subs that have come on are all youth Internationals for their prospective countries and that&#39;s why it&#39;s a great Examination for these Liverpool players to play against players like that could be one of the toughest games they have all season it really could be yeah it will be won&#39;t it with the quality of the opposition the age differences as well comfortable in possession of the ball aren&#39;t they Under Pressure there works it really well to beat Liverpool&#39;s press here they go again this time Terrence miles and Morrison defensively oh he can&#39;t be doing back heels like that on the edge of your own penalty area got to be careful nalo taking a chance under real pressure there from Gilbert I just wonder if Jay SP might be having a quiet word there with Morrison not there we need you further up the pitch to be doing that sort of thing we know when TR K do gets fit again hopefully in the next few weeks that 21&#39;s going to have an exciting look to it with K doy down one side Morrison down the other there&#39;s plenty of supply line there isn&#39;t there yeah uh and we&#39;ve mentioned it a few times but when the window closes we&#39;ll have a better idea what the 21s will look like this season and and there&#39;ll be some good moments there&#39;ll be some some disappointments like this one tonight but some good moments think back to last season 4-n against Everton that was a good one beating Man United at Old Trafford 3-0 for the 21 what a great night that was Dy goal that was a great goal that went viral on social media must have done absolute Beauty unin Gilbert but even that one o draw against Benfica last year was it was a decent result for these young Lads because that was a tough night they were a much more experienced older group so Bar L making another change now and Welly lucky who we&#39;ve saw was a regular in the under 18 Squad coming on for Amara nalo now 18 well came to Liverpool under 13 level he hails from zarag goth in Spain played it the weekend did well Welly which was his first start for the under 21s so hopefully he can push on he&#39;ll certainly get plenty of game time well lucky at this level this season that is for sure MC backing his own skill there against Javon Simons spearing nice turn by cores Morrison good running there by Young that&#39;s unlucky this is Lee Jonas who&#39;s related to our big Liverpool fan Natasha Jonas who is a world champion and she got it right on her very own soil in Liverpool brilliant yeah absolutely Morrison plus the under 21s back in Premier League 2 action this Saturday taking on Leicester city we&#39;ll have extended highlights on our channels of that one on Monday good play by Jonas but ranel young had just run offside it was tight did look close well done to Jonas there got there ahead of the tsv man to play that pass and now two more changes coming up Yi baa Nicholas vaken coming on for PSV for the last 10 minutes for alons gron and dkes team and yesper an aen scored a goal at the header which was an unfortunate home goal from mlfy in the end are we not give him too no he he can&#39;t have that goal that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a known goal isn&#39;t it even even you tell it even K even KY even Kirky would tell you m would say to you mels even you wouldn&#39;t be claiming that goal mind you knowing you you probably would but they go again and they might get another one with the substitute what a block by Welly lucky threw himself at that challenge that&#39;s a great ball by cores and ranell Young on The Chase and the goalkeeper Nick shiks was out of his goal quickly endtoend action there well it&#39;s a goal saving block I think that&#39;s what you would say it looked like it was from from luie the shot came in goal saving Block in the end here it is what a block that is really is PSV champions in in the Dutch League last year yeah absolutely by the way looking at a Yi reminds me of it remember Yi Brower who led the line for Liverpool reserves years ago he&#39;s still playing by the way at the age of 35 where is he playing now&#39;s standing third tier of Dutch Football I still playing Wonder we could be a potential opponent for us in the Champions League this season no idea how they&#39;re going to seed it all where they are qualifying still going on isn&#39;t it for Champions League at the moment you say they probably just make it up as to go along yeah yeah he got beat by fire Nord in the Yen C Shield though you see that four all be on P great to have us back in the Europe&#39;s Top Flight competition though because of course last weekend was the uh 60th anniversary Liverpool playing their first ever game in Europe unbelievable that we&#39;ve had some good times we&#39;ve had some good times more to come yeah we can look forward to being back in the Champions League this season don&#39;t forget folks more live Academy football coming your way Saturday lunchtime 12:30 kickoff the under 18&#39;s first home game of the season against middleb spearing rolling Back The Years there cores spotted the keeper off his line oh imaginative from the wand why not goalkeeper was scampering back there Jay winning the tackle initially little look at the man to say don&#39;t be leaving your studs there and then cores having the vision just a little bit too much on it in the end go had it covered anyway just a warning you&#39;re going to be off your line might be able to lob you from there good challenge there from Rell young spearing Morrison lovely touch Morrison it opens up will he go in alone Morrison but he&#39;s kept going the Northern Ireland under 19 International yeah kept going he&#39;s nice and bright sharp in the final third to get his attempts well to Jay spearing there&#39;s not a lot on when he picks the ball up goes past a couple of challenges could he have hit it there comes a little bit tight of the angle he got a cross goal tried to beat the goalkeeper on his near post you know still only 17 playing against a lot of players in this PSV team who are more experienced than he is pinnington wanted a flag eventually it does go up against verusen I still don&#39;t like that you know when you look at the lineup if say he&#39;s miles offside and then 15 yards later when he took is it the flag goes up Phil Thompson was going crazy with us at the weekend with that rule was a number of times wasn&#39;t it don&#39;t like that surely they&#39;ll change it eventually somebody&#39;s blatantly offside lovely composure by cores because then the free kicks where he touched the ball rather than where he&#39;s offside you can see already kind the the difference he was on restricted minutes tonight after playing the full 19 the weekend but cores just got that cool head in in tight situations hasn&#39;t he Gilbert gets I think PSV have eased off as well you made a number of Subs themselves 40 up enabled them to do that as you say this will be one of Liverpool under 21&#39;s toughest tests of the season this game oh whipped across goal there from Vander black certainly could have gone anywhere that one spearing Terren miles lafy after it you call a Jay cruncher by the way I think you say he knows what he&#39;s doing just sort of left on on him there this was the ball wasn&#39;t it in from the right hand side they work it well out to this right hand side there the cross it&#39;s in that sort of area where if they&#39;ve got someone attacking it tapping for them been a tough one but been a good learning curve for the boys this one you new players settling into life with the 21 Squad that we&#39;ll see on a regular basis this season a number of regulars who could have played missing for a number of reasons PSV with the set piece cleared away initially by ryell Young yeah painful night for the young Lads but it&#39;s about learning like to say they won&#39;t come up against T Test in this all season we kept going the heads haven&#39;t dropped despite the disappointment in in the score line again you would say on this evidence me PSV will probably fancy the chances of reaching a third successive final if they keep the nucleus of the squad together good tackle by spearing can Liverpool get one back near the end ryell young lot of space out wide for Morrison can he produce a bit of quality lovely turn unlucky he is unlucky yeah he&#39;s got the shot away it&#39;s Ricochet back against him encouraging trying to break for but PSV get players back really well defensively remember remember that ball in the youth Cup against Arsenal you produced for the Kum I head are you airing about that last year W yeah absolutely had some good moments in that last year yeah seven against Arsenal here on this pitch still some of them are still so young out there Steve they really I let you say at 17 to be playing against Lads that are three years older in in development tactically learning the game phys know as well it is a tough challenge for the lads and you can you&#39;ll say this what you Ms as a former play you can learn a lot from this experience tonight well well you have to there&#39;s no point in hiding away from it because painful nights happen in football whatever level you play at if you want to improve as a player you have to learn the fourth goal set pieces you can&#39;t be giving people free headers any level of football two minutes to go here in the opening group game of the Premier League International cup Gilbert going for goal and mcure at the second attempt grabbing it a 17y old yeah he&#39;s had to make a few saves tonight I think the best one he made was the one from Thomas I thought that was probably the best he&#39;s had tonight I think this one you&#39;d expect to see him save this one did take a slight deflection I think it did on its way go quickly to make sure he got that he got the the rebounds so the ups and downs of Youth Football brilliant performance and a win against Manchester City in Premier League 2 opening day on Saturday disappointing night here with one or two regulars missing a few like jayen Dans Oakley caner Josh Davidson Tran con doy Isaac Maya injured working the way back good minutes again for the likes of Tom Hill who got through back-to-back games for the first time in a long while try to break here good defending by Lee Jonas getting back against fusen yeah yeah and timed his challenge you know he may have been in tempted to have made it a little bit earlier could have conceded penalty but timed it well Jonas again stopping Simons breaking away I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a lot of added on time did you see Shawn D press conference he said why are you putting eight minutes on we&#39;re losing 3-0 just keep it down to two or three minutes that was his argument so so I&#39;m expecting like literally a couple of minutes here if we see six minutes can&#39;t be seeing that surely well another set piece for PSV Simons gets a very windy night here in Kirby so added time sum it up Forest mes painful at times for the young players coming up against older lads more experienced players it&#39;s only three minutes by the way three minutes sensible yeah absolutely but but these are the sort of occasions we knew at times this season because of the timing of this game with players available and that sort of thing you can have these sort of nights and it&#39;s about keeping your head learning from it not enjoyable not enjoyable games at all for the young players to play in but it is about learning for the development and that&#39;s why our Academy director Alex single thought Barry luus wants these challenges for the players playing against Ur being in opposition used to different styles different formations different tactics are we going to see a shot coming in from Dom cores you never know in the cury wind he he did score two goals direct from Corners I remember hean the under 18 fancing it isn&#39;t he so Dominic cores right at the end just couldn&#39;t quite get it down no he faned it got it over the wall couldn&#39;t get it down in time to trouble the goalkeeper did Jay say unlucky or I&#39;ll take the next one so still to play against Hera from Berlin of course Sparta prag and Nord charland all the games played in England it&#39;s the top two from each group and two best third place teams make the quarterfinals so despite this result all is certainly not lost as far as the competition is concerned as we said before Liverpool teams playing against all the others in this competition you might have stronger Liverpool teams you just don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen in terms of the lone window who stays who goes but a disappointing Night results wise but a great learning experience for these young players beaten 4-0 though Liverpool by PSV einhoven second team in the opening game of the Premier League International cup Israel youth International Tai Abed cut inside to atet the opener yes but onen doubled the lead then after a good start in the second half when Tom Hill went close Isaac bardi ran through to score and then a a rather unfortunate own goal Michael lafy bundled the ball in from a corner kick in the end Liverpool give it everything kieren Morrison getting experience the likes of Cornell MCO the goalkeeper Kell Figaroa Kyle Kelly making the first start really for the under 21s but overall Neil M it&#39;s a night of big learning cures yeah absolutely disappointment from a Liverpool Point of View Credit has to go to PSV I thought they were really impressive they they showed that experience certainly a lot more than a youthful Liverpool side tonight disappointment of course with the score line but lots to learn yeah lots to learn going forward as I say qualification is certainly still not out of the equation stly certainly plenty more football to come but for the likes of Cornell msco and the boys they&#39;ll take a lot from the experience of playing in this competition thanks for your company as always folks better times to come but tonight is it finished Liverpool under 21&#39;s nil p sv4 [Music] [Music]"
