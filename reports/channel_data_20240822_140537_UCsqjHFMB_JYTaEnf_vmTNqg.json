      "subtitles": "an O2 WRX is not selling for 18 even if it had one mile and Kenan licked the steering wheel this car is a future Classic this car changed the world it brought Japanese performance cars back to the US after they all went away it was the video game car the first one that came Evo didn&#39;t come to low three GTR didn&#39;t come to low 7 this thing showed up and said yes we will try performance cars in America and now they sell they are relegated to the corners of cars and bids where they sell for Seven Grand it is a so you you want to put a date on when this one will be worth something just like you did with the Land Cruiser a couple weeks ago because I have it in my calendar all I add it this one too so I don&#39;t know when it&#39;s gonna happen Kenan but it&#39;s gonna happen the moral story is according to Doug if you have one of these cars and it&#39;s very nice and very clean and very unmodified no one does hold on to it exactly this one was it and you missed it so congratulations to whoever won this one"

      "subtitles": "this is the 2024 Lexus LC 500 Cabriolet and this car has a lot of great things going for it beautiful styling naturally aspirated V8 gorgeous interior all of that has been true since this car came out like 6 years ago but the 24 LC has been updated with some important new changes and I think they make this version abs absolutely the one to have today I&#39;ll review the lc500 Cabriolet and explain why and show you all of this car&#39;s quirks and [Applause] features today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern Enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has hosted more than 20,000 car auctions of special cool and interesting cars like this and this and this and this so if you&#39;re looking to buy or sell an Enthusiast car do it on cars and bids all right time for the quirks and features of the LC 500 starting with a brief overview namely an explanation this is lexus&#39;s luxury performance convertible you probably don&#39;t associate the Lexus brand with performance or or convertibles but they do have this now there are many great things about the Lexus lc500 especially for the 24 model year but the greatest is this engine the lc500 has a 5 L naturally aspirated V8 with about 470 horsepower and about 400 lb feet of torque one of the last great na V8 engines to exist in the entire car world is installed in this car it&#39;s great on paper the numbers are fantastic and it sounds pretty good too take a [Music] listen now this car is also offered in hybrid form they sell something called the lc500h that has a hybrid V6 with about 350 horsepower do not get this engine no matter what you do don&#39;t get that powertrain it&#39;s more efficient but you lose the primary benefit of this car which is one of the very last na V8s in the entire car world and a great one at that skip the lc500h please and Beyond the powertrain there are other great benefits of this car for one thing it&#39;s rear wheeel drive you could totally see Lexus coming out with a luxury performance convertible and then making it front-wheel drive negating any enthusiest interest in the car but that&#39;s not the case here rear wheeel drive and it&#39;s absolutely beautiful the lc500 is a gorgeous car every line every angle it is truly fantastic fantastically designed a beautiful and truly desirable car you turn your head and look every time you see one on the street it&#39;s amazing that Lexus gave us the LFA Supercar which was not particularly attractive and then years later came out with this much more beautiful for far less money the LFA may still be the cool sporty Lexus but this is the Nic looking one but all of these things have been true about the Lexus LC since it came out back in 2018 it&#39;s always had the na8 it&#39;s always been rear wheeel drive and it&#39;s always been beautiful so you&#39;re thinking why am I watching this crap why don&#39;t I just go turn on throttle house well the answer is the newest LC the 2024 model has received one tremendously important upgrade the infotainment system now again before you switch over to Thomas and James let me tell you why this is important since the LC first came out 6 years ago it has used lexus&#39;s remote touch interface which is the single worst piece of automotive equipment perpetrated on the consumer since the handcrank starter basically it was like a computer mouse that you had to move around to select things while all other vehicles were making do with touch screens where you just tap on something in the Lexus LC and similar Lexus models you would have to scroll around on a trackpad and perfectly click on what you were looking for while also driving down the road it was terrible total trash the worst infotainment system in the history of the car industry including those really early BMW ones where the screen had about 11 pixels and three colors finally they have ditched it other Lexus models have gotten rid of remote touch over the last few years and I wasn&#39;t sure if that change was going to make its way into the LC because well this car isn&#39;t very popular but for 24 it now has a touchscreen lexus&#39;s terrible infotainment is gone and it is replaced with a sensible reasonable situation and you got to figure this won&#39;t last for very long the Lexus LC has not exactly been a strong seller it&#39;s an expensive car with a narrow Market segment and frankly it&#39;s had six years of sales to already take place now we&#39;re down to the very end of the production run you have to assume Lexus won&#39;t let this car go on much longer and we finally got the good technology so I say this is the one to have because it finally has great Tech it&#39;s the end of the line it&#39;s going to be low production low volume this is the special one and in 20 years when we&#39;re talking about the Lexus LC and its big na8 people are always going to say yeah well you know you got to get a 24 or later car in order to have the best one that&#39;s this and this will be the best one now if you want it of course it&#39;s going to be pricey the coupe with a fixed roof starts around $100,000 this car the convertible starts around 106 not cheap but a lot of great benefits in this car especially now so now that we&#39;ve established this is a desirable car let&#39;s go through its cirks and features starting with getting inside you walk up you can see the door handle is flush with the body you unlock the doors the door handle pops out and reveals a Lexus logo that had been hidden until then which is kind of cool next you open up the door and in this particular LC you can see one of the most beautiful Interiors in any Japanese car frankly in just about any car on sale today absolutely gorgeous layout but also the colors in here are fantastic these cream white seats with these royal blue accents and the spiderweb like stitching on the seats everything looks really really beautiful in here very cool and very high-end this interior is part of a new upgrade that Lexus is offering on the 24 LC called a bespoke build interior you can see the plaque here that says Lexus bespoke build the thinking is you get more personalization and customization options so you can go wild with your interior and make it beautiful and change colors and stitching to your heart&#39;s content and this car displays some of what&#39;s possible if looks fantastic but beyond the colors and the stitching in this interior just the regular materials that you get in every Lexus LC are absolutely fantastic you can see in the center control stack here this beautiful sort of platinum Chrome that just looks great a lot better than plastic or aluminum it&#39;s a gorgeous look and they have it all throughout the center the center console you can see near the shift lever this gorgeous look and feel material in here I also so love how the door handles are just sort of floating on the door panel they&#39;re not integrated into the design Instead This Platinum like husk just sort of sticks out and you grab it to get out of the car it looks very cool even the glove box opener button in this car is attractive and gentle you press it and without a sound the glove box is delivered it&#39;s a very beautiful feeling even something as stupid and simple as opening up the glove box this interior really is fantastic but there are many more quirks to cover here so let&#39;s start with the dial next to the gauge cluster that&#39;s sort of sticking out from the gauge cluster shroud you can see it here this is your drive mode dial and the cool thing about this is when you adjust it the gauge cluster screen adjusts in pretty cool way you go from normal to sport you can see here it gets sportier then you go into Sport Plus and it gets even sportier still which is pretty neat the other neat thing is if you switch it the other direction to go into comfort and Eco it also changes in those modes and Eco even replaces the engine temperature gauge with an Eco dial as you can see but the coolest thing about the gauge cluster in this car it moves check this out this button on the steering wheel you push it and then the gauge cluster moves over to provide you with a new screen that gives vehicle information and various different readouts and settings that you can change press it again and the cluster moves back into the center this is not just some screen that&#39;s moving around it is a physical dial that&#39;s moving in place which is so cool Lexus first had this in the LFA superar and since then it&#39;s trickled down into some other sporty models like this and the is sports sedan and it is just a cool feature and a wonderful Quirk now also worth pointing out the switch over on the other side of the gauge Club cluster this will put you in snow mode if you want or turn on and off your traction control but anyway next we move into the center console here which is largely the same as the previous Lexus LC although you lose that trackpad like I had mentioned that you had for the remote Touch system since we&#39;ve now moved on to a touch screen otherwise fairly similar fairly familiar controls from the old LC in here although unquestionably the weirdest one is the control for the heated seats to turn on your heated seats you press a button right here and then that brings up a menu in the screen that lets you turn the heated seats on or off if you&#39;re going to include a heated seat button just let me push the button to turn on the heated seats come on Lexus why turn this into a two-step process especially since you already have a button they were so close to getting it and then they didn&#39;t they gave you the physical button but you still have to use the screen now fortunately for the climate control that is not integrated into the screen never has been in Alexus LC instead you have it here below the screen with these nice sort of platinum Chrome switches which are all very luxurious to press and to look at and of course it means no stupid menus to go through here for your climate control now speaking of the climate system one unusual item in this car is the climate vents you can see one to the left of the steering wheel fairly standard one to the right on the passenger side also standard in the midle middle you only have one vent which isn&#39;t that unusual it&#39;s a fairly small car small interior you don&#39;t need more but you have more above the glove box you can see two more climate vents meaning that the passenger side of this interior has three and if they wanted to use the center one four which seems like a little bit of climate vent Overkill in a convertible but that&#39;s what they&#39;ve done so that&#39;s how it is now back to the center console here couple of other interesting things for one the cup holder clearly an afterthought it&#39;s located here under this panel you push it open it up you only have one cup holder and it&#39;s pretty small but there is a second hidden cup holder check this out if you move the center armrest back push this down and move it back you have another cup holder here it&#39;s square but you can stick a drink in here if you need to and a pinch if you have two cups that need holding also in this center console area you have a button marked View with a camera on it unfortunately it pulls up the stupidest camera view in history where a camera like floats around the LC with an egg shape and you can&#39;t position it where you want this is lexus&#39;s version of a 3D camera it&#39;s terrible compared to other brands where you can swipe and exactly show what you want to see this is what the LC has hey at least it&#39;s not in the remote touch controller screen anymore now the really neat party trick in this center console is the power top operation which is hidden under this little Mound it looks like this is here is just a handrest where you&#39;d stick your hand while you&#39;re controlling say the stereo volume or the track or turning on the heated seats but below this handrest you flip it up and there&#39;s your power top control and you push that button and it&#39;s pretty simple the top goes up and as you can see it&#39;s quite fast it goes up unusually quickly for basically any convertible even though this is a somewhat large car it&#39;s a small top it doesn&#39;t cover that much area and it just goes up and then it&#39;s in place and same deal when you want to put it down just push the switch in the other direction the top unlatches itself and goes down as quickly as possible very Speedy process and you can do it while you&#39;re driving as long as you&#39;re going a fairly slow speed now the other control that&#39;s hidden under this little panel is this button which will raise or lower all of the windows at once this is fantastic you push it up and all of the windows go up the two front windows and the little windows for the back seats this can be helpful if you just put up the roof it started raining you don&#39;t have to individually put up all the windows one button will do it all and it can be useful if you just put the roof down and you want all the windows down at once push that button and they all go down or of course if you&#39;re transitioning from Street driving to the freeway with the top down you want the Windows Up For Less wind noise well you can do that it is a very cool feature to have one button that can raise or lower all of the windows but anyway other quirks in this interior for one thing the gear selector is a bit unusual if you want to put the car into drive you move it to the left so towards you in the driver&#39;s seat and then down and you&#39;re in drive you want to go into reverse you move it to the left and then up and you&#39;re in reverse and neutral is just straight to the left if you want to engage manual mode you pull it down when you&#39;re in drive and then you can manually shift using the pedals on the steering wheel Park is just a button next to all this stuff it&#39;s a fairly standard gear selector situation in Toyota and Lexus models especially hybrids but if you&#39;re not familiar with it it can be a little unusual also interesting a little quirky when you lock the doors when you press the door lock button there&#39;s a little light mounted on the door panel where a physical door lock would be and it turns green you&#39;d think it would turn red to say locked but instead it turns green which means locked seems a little bit odd and that light is weird generally but it&#39;s there a nice little Quirk now Last Thing Worth pointing out setting up is the infotainment system itself like I said new touchcreen that&#39;s the big news for 24 and frankly well it&#39;s okay it&#39;s actually not that great of an infotainment system it does exactly what you&#39;d expect it to doesn&#39;t really have any crazy exciting cool features Worth showing off but it is responsive it&#39;s a large screen very intuitive to use very simple just not particularly exciting or thrilling in any way still dramatically better than what they had before next up let&#39;s move on to the back back seats which as you can see are tremendously tiny these are like the Tinker toy back seats absolutely laughably small nobody could ever possibly dream of getting inside them they even come with this ridiculously tiny florat that almost looks like kind of a joke but it&#39;s there to go along with the ridiculously tiny back seats now couple of interesting things worth noting for one the seat belts come out of the center and then buckled to the side which is the opposite of how they work in most other cars including the front seats in this one so that&#39;s kind of an interesting Quirk now the seat belts also have a feature where you can pin them to the seat uses a magnet it kind of keeps them in place I guess because you don&#39;t want them flopping around when you&#39;re driving fast with the top down the winds blowing and also you would do that because no one will ever actually use these seat belts so you might as well just kind of keep them in place now the other thing you&#39;ll notice back here it&#39;s only two seats one on each side you don&#39;t have a center seat in the middle I can only imagine how uncomfortable that would be instead you have a speaker for the mark levenson sound system in the middle which I&#39;m sure provides a great sound experience while your knees are getting crushed now also worth pointing out back here on the backs of the front headrest you have the Lexus L embossed into the leather although I think this is more a commentary on what type of person you are if you&#39;re stuck in in the back seat of this Cod ha anyway the other the other thing worth noting back here is the wind deflector mounted on top of the back seats you can see it here it&#39;s a tremendously small piece of glass fixed in place you can&#39;t take it off you wouldn&#39;t think it would do all that much but they wouldn&#39;t have put it there if it didn&#39;t it&#39;s supposed to keep wind kind of blowing over the interior and not directly in your face while you&#39;re driving with the roof down and finally we move outside the Lexus LC to talk through its exterior quirks and features starting with the tail lights which are very cool you can see there&#39;s like a series of L&#39;s I guess for Lexus sort of going through the tail lights like a 3D image it&#39;s a very cool look when you get up close with one of these and look into the tail lights when they&#39;re on I also like the turn signals back here this vertical turn signal design is very eye-catching very different from what you might expect in a car like this and same deal up front you have a similar vertical turn signal design up here again a little bit head turning a little bit daring and exciting which is kind of cool I also love the front headlight situation especially the running light where you have this led it&#39;s almost a check mark kind of starting at the Bodywork and then going inside into the lighting cluster it&#39;s a cool element that again adds to the neat and sort of Daring styling of this car finally last thing worth talking about is the trunk the cargo area situation you open up the trunk and you can see well it&#39;s quite small actually surprisingly small because this car is one of those ones that old guys take to the golf course and so they would want to be able to put their clubs in it but there&#39;s not a lot of space you could probably fit a set of golf clubs in here but you&#39;ll be mashing it down which nobody really likes to do so a little bit of a tight trunk situation but that&#39;s the compromise you make to drive around in Lexus LC Beauty all right driving the updated 2024 Lexus lc500 driving with the roof on right now just for sound purposes but I&#39;ve been driving this car around with the roof off and it is glorious it is so nice just the wind rushing in in this fantastic car that looks great and feels great so let&#39;s get into it starting with the powertrain which is absolutely excellent this 5 L naturally aspirated V8 is one of the very last engines of its kind that still exists in the whole world and boy is it nice excellent power on tap you just drop your foot a little bit and you get a great throttle response really quick to respond ah and the sound is just so good and there might be piped in sound I don&#39;t know but it just sounds like an old school na8 like exactly what you&#39;d want from a exciting enjoyable Fun sports car it&#39;s just such a neat place to be and then the powertrain is a fantastic [Music] compliment Roar now I will say that I think the transmission could use a little bit of help unless you&#39;re deep into a sport mode it&#39;s a little slow to respond but it is a nice and smooth and comfortable transmission uh which is a which is a great benefit now one other nice thing about this car when you&#39;re cruising around if you got the roof up you don&#39;t really hear all that much going on now it&#39;s not bentle convertible quiet where somehow you really hear nothing even though it still has a clothed softtop but you don&#39;t hear much and so you do have a pretty luxurious experience the exception is ride quality it&#39;s not that rough especially if you&#39;re in a comfort mode or a custom mode where you&#39;ve chosen a comfort suspension but it&#39;s not like a Bentley or like an S-Class Cabriolet this was intended to be a sportier car it was specifically designed to be sporer more engaging than your typical Lexus and so even in its most comfortable setting it doesn&#39;t beat you up but it&#39;s harsher than a luxury car it doesn&#39;t feel like some comfortable thing that&#39;s costing you that isn&#39;t really the goal of the Lexus LC it was supposed to be a sporty car and it feels like that and it sounds like that and it has the power like that like all of the boxes are checked except the brand name you think you think four seater Lexus convertible you&#39;re going to be getting a comfortable ride well not quite I&#39;ve been driving this around all week here in some Southern California where there&#39;s a lot of cars on the road a lot of special cars and um I haven&#39;t seen a single other one they&#39;re just they&#39;re just not common you you can you have a pretty rare and special head turning and exciting car and it&#39;s gorgeous to look at now one other thing worth noting uh is the steering with this car which isn&#39;t as sporty as you might be thinking if you if you&#39;re looking at the rest of the specs the steering is a little slow and a little over assisted and that way they went a little bit more Lexus and even if you go into plus mode or a comfort mode with the sportiest steering possible it&#39;s just not that sporty this car kind of lives in an interesting middle ground between luxury and Sport and it&#39;s more on the sporty side but it&#39;s not entirely and completely sport only uh and that&#39;s definitely clear with like the steering the handling is pretty good it stays relatively flat but it&#39;s clear that this car wasn&#39;t designed to be a dynamic Masterpiece it is a good car it is a sporty car but it is not you know a 911 let&#39;s put it that way although it certainly looks better than a 911 overall I&#39;m really impressed with this car I&#39;ve always loved the Lexus LC since it first came out and I first reviewed it in Connecticut like 7 years ago and I just think this is the best version and I think it&#39;s sad that it&#39;s only coming at the very end we finally got the good infotainment you know they finally added a convertible we still have the na8 the convertible came a few years ago but it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t there immediately like they finally got all the ingredients right to just make it as good as humanly possible it&#39;s just a neat combination of things that we probably won&#39;t see again especially considering how sales have gone um the the days of these bigger coups are CPS convertibles luxury cars are kind of coming to an end in favor of SUVs and sportier vehicles and so this was a this was a fun thing to have for a few years and they&#39;ve now just made it the best version of itself and I think it&#39;s a special car I think it&#39;s a truly special car and so that&#39;s the 2024 Lexus LC 500 this car is special it&#39;s always been special but now that the infotainment isn&#39;t awful and now that the production numbers are particularly low this one is especially special and now it&#39;s time to give the updated Lexus LC a Doug score and the Doug score is here 67 out of 100 which puts the LC 500 convertible at the top of this list of competitors and with good reason is this car is really really desirable the LC has always been awesome beautiful fast exciting with a tremendously enjoyable engine but the updated technology finally solves its only weak spot Lexus must be frustrated that such a fantastic car has found such a small Niche group of buyers but such as life with cars in this segment these days nobody really wants an expensive big Cooper Convertible but if you do don&#39;t buy a new SL don&#39;t buy a new BMW 8 series buy a new Lexus LC with the updated infotainment system this is definitely the best in the business unless you really need the performance and brand name of a pora 911 [Applause] [Music]"

biggest Quirk which is what is this and how does it fit into Toyota&#39;s lineup so Toyota say says this is a two row crossover SUV and it&#39;s replacing the Venza which is ending production later this year this goes on sale sometime this summer however I take issue with some of Toyota&#39;s statements here let&#39;s start with the crossover SUV component I got out my trusty cars and bids tape measure and found that this is about 63 and a half in high which makes it shorter in height than a Subaru Outback which is about 66 in high now one could easily make the argument that the Outback has gotten so much larger over the years it is no longer really a wagon but it&#39;s now kind of a crossover itself which could make this also a crossover but still if you think of the Outback as a wagon this is shorter in height now the crown signia is taller than my Mercedes E-Class station wagon which is undoubtedly a wagon at 59 in in height but we&#39;re only talking about a few inches difference between all these cars and none of them are really approaching tall SUV crossover height so to me this feels a little bit more wagon than SUV now if you agree with Toyota and call this a crossover it means that they now have nine different Crossovers and SUVs I&#39;m going to try to name them the bz 4X the Corolla cross the Rav 4 the Highlander the grand Highlander that&#39;s five the 4Runner the Land Cruiser this and the seoa nine different different SUVs which means that each segment is chopped pretty thin and it doesn&#39;t leave a whole lot of space for a new one this and that&#39;s specifically true when you consider exactly what space it&#39;s occupying so check this out Toyota is cancelling the Venza for the second time they&#39;ve had an original Venza it was cancelled years later came out with a second Venza it was also cancelled the reason it didn&#39;t sell all that well now the Venza was a two row crossover just like the Rav 4 but it was more expensive consumers didn&#39;t really seem to want that so the Venza is gone the problem is the Venza started around $36,000 this replacing the Venza starts around $45,000 so it&#39;s more expensive than the vehicle that was just cancelled due to poor sales and in fact the $45,000 starting price of the crown signia makes it more expensive than a regular Toyota Highlander which offers more power more size and three row seating compared to the two row seating in the crown signia now I will admit readily that the crown signia is a lot nicer inside than a Highlander especially a Highlander that you can get in its price range the 45 to 50 low $50,000 Highlander this is definitely nicer and that is a key to this vehicle&#39;s positioning but I still kind of question the theory that someone&#39;s going to want a two row crossover like a RAV four but at a cost that&#39;s like a kind of mid or hi trim Highlander it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s really that many people who are going to be interested in that again considering it&#39;s got less practicality than the Highlander and less power in performance now with that said for some people the crown signos powertrain will actually be an asset even though it&#39;s got less power than a Highlander and that&#39;s because this comes standard with a hybrid powertrain that gets fantastic mileage it&#39;s a 2.5 5 L hybrid 4 cylinder it maxes out at only 240 horsepower that&#39;s not a huge number especially for a midsize crossover wagy thing and the result is 0 to 60 in just over 7 Seconds not tremendously fast it&#39;s not so slow that it&#39;s going to be dangerous but it&#39;s not exactly high performance however the benefit is you get 38 m per gallon in Combined City and highway driving and that&#39;s with all-wheel drive which comes standard on the crown signia so almost 40 m per gallon the tradeoff is some performance and power but really great fuel economy and still all- weather security of all-wheel drive but anyway on to the crks and features of the crown signia Beyond just the crown signia itself we begin with the key which is not just a regular Toyota key this is the key to my Sequoia it&#39;s a boring regular key because I&#39;ve bought a boring regular to Toyota but the crown gets this key that says Toyota Crown in this special area on the back that makes you feel more luxurious than a standard Toyota buyer but before we climb inside let&#39;s talk exterior quirks starting with the frontend styling which is a little unorthodox you come up here there&#39;s a lot going on so this thin light strip positioned where the headlight usually is is not the headlight it&#39;s the L running light and it becomes the turn signal when you put on the turn signal the headlight is actually here in this position which kind of seems like where a fog light should be but no that&#39;s the headlight now if you go above both of these things you have this which is just a hole so you have the headlight in a weird spot the running light in a weird spot and then a hole now if you move to the center you have the grill which is also a little bit odd it&#39;s sort of got a bunch of openings and then it fades into fewer openings basically none and that&#39;s your grill situation aside from the kind of weird front end in this car though I have to say I really like how the crown signia looks I am a fan of wagons I really kind of think this is one and I think they&#39;ve done a great job making it look nice which is impressive because the crown sedan is kind of a heinous car it is really not a particularly attractive vehicle wheels are too big the windows are too small small the whole profile is odd the front end is weird they&#39;ve done a much better job with the signia adding on the rear end making it premium luxurious it looks nice good very welld designed I think this is a surprisingly attractive vehicle and that&#39;s also true inside the attractiveness of the crown signia definitely carries over to the interior where you have well a surprisingly nice one it&#39;s well laid out it&#39;s beautiful really an attractive space in here it&#39;s almost knocking on the door of Lexus quality despite not having a Lexus brand name by the way that&#39;s another competitor for this car the Lexus NX and RX are not tremendously more expensive either which is also in the Toyota portfolio but if for some reason you want a nice Toyota without the Lexus brand name this car clearly delivers on the inside you can also see the seats are very attractive the upper part is this nice stitching and cool design and there is a very minimal use of cheap plastic even on the dashboard basically everything you can see feel and touch is some high quality material it all looks and feels surprisingly nice inside the crown signia and that gives it some advantage over other models in the Toyota lineup even at its high price tag now on the inside of the crown signia there are some interesting quirks and features worth pointing out one that I absolutely love is the rear view mirror camera you can see right now the rear viiew mirror is a rear viw mirror but if you flip this switch it becomes a camera and you can see behind you a lot easier you don&#39;t have to look through the entire vehicle it&#39;s a fantastic feature so glad Toyota is implementing it on so many cars I wish other manufacturers would follow suit now you also have a center console here that&#39;s not surprising but the cool part is it opens from driver or passenger side you got a button on one side you can open it you flip it the other way you got a button on the passenger side I don&#39;t know how they do it it&#39;s magic but they do and it&#39;s wonderful they hand another interesting quirk of the crown signia is the wireless cell phone charger a lot of cars have them this one has it placed pretty well it&#39;s located here in the center console and it&#39;s completely vertical not flat like in some cars takes up a lot of space here the space is minimal and it&#39;s hard to show it on camera but there&#39;s even little clips that hold your phone in place inside this little hole to make sure it stays charging even if you go over bumps or around corners which is a neat idea also how&#39;s this for an interesting Quirk and the crown signia you can of course turn on your heated seats your cooled seats and your heated steering wheel or you can let the car decide for you you&#39;ve heard of automatic climate control where you select a temperature and then the car makes that temperature happen inside well here you can select automatic heated and cooled seats and steering wheel and the car will turn them on or off depending on the temperature so you don&#39;t have to press anything you get inside and it&#39;s cold your heated seat will be automatically on if you want same with the steering wheel of course you can still manually turn them on but Auto heated seats and cooled seats is a pretty cool feature and on the subject of heating things this car has a heated windshield the button is over here to the left of the steering wheel you push it and it turns on the heated windshield now unlike some really high-end off- rotors it isn&#39;t the whole windshield that gets heated but just an element around the edges of the windshield will heat it regardless this is a great feature to have because it can heat up the ice that&#39;s binding your wind Shield wipers to the windshield on a very cold day and make it easier for you to drive off and other ice to melt off the windshield that&#39;s nice to have one other interesting item in here you have paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel upshift and downshift this is a feature that in the crown signia will never ever be used and next up another interesting button to the left of the steering wheel this button here is for the headlight washers if you press that little Jets shoot out from right above the headlights in order to clean them and you can do it whenever you want you feel like your headlights are a little dirty or Dusty maybe from being mounted so low just push the button and then they&#39;re clean and you don&#39;t have to do it yourself like some plean and next up we move on to the technology in this car which is actually pretty decent I already mentioned the mirror camera which I like but then we have the center infotainment screen Toyota&#39;s infotainment technology is pretty good this screen is actually relative ATIV L small but it still works reasonably well fairly intuitive very responsive nice and easy to use and of course Apple carplay and Android auto come standard one drawback of this infotainment system is that you can&#39;t have two panels showing at once so you can&#39;t have your navigation and your music at the same time but that&#39;s not really that huge of a deal easy to switch between them I will say another drawback is the absolutely ridiculous surround view camera system you press this view button and it turns on and then just sort of shows this egg-shaped camera image around the car you can&#39;t twist it or move it like in every other car with one of these cameras you just have to kind of wait for it to show the spot you want to see it&#39;s absurd however I will say one thing I love that I&#39;ve learned from owning my Sequoia if you&#39;re in drive and you press that same camera view button it pops up the full regular camera system in this car which is a pretty good system and it shows more angles and better high quality images this is especially nice because the camera only comes on if you&#39;re in Reverse but in case you&#39;re pulling into some tight area and you haven&#39;t shifted into reverse but you still want to see the cameras you get an easy way to do that by just pressing the view Button as long as you&#39;re in drw now as for the gauge cluster in the crown signia I got to say I really like it I&#39;m very impressed with it which is a surprise because previous Toyota digital gauge clusters I have really not loved including the one in my seoa which I would say is only okay that&#39;s a 24 model this a 25 and they&#39;ve updated it well to add more configurability you can now configure all three panels in this digital gauge cluster so on the left you can have your audio what&#39;s playing in the center you can have a map on the right you can have your current trip details odometer Etc or you can mix it up and show various other things on all of those screens they&#39;re all configurable and they let you basically see whatever it is that you might want it&#39;s hard to imagine wanting even more and you can even focus this screen more if you want you can get rid of the digital gauges the circle components and have your info displayed in an even larger size on all three of these panels it&#39;s a great digital gauge cluster we&#39;ve been waiting for a good one from Toyota and this is the first new Toyota I&#39;ve seen with a really good system for the gauge cluster also another cool thing in the gauge cluster one of the displays actually gives you an Eco score when you&#39;re driving along it&#39;ll rate how eco-friendly you&#39;re driving how fuele efficient you&#39;re driving and so you can measure that against previous drives and see just how economically you&#39;re driving the car which is kind of cool and next up we move on to the back seat in the crown signia and I got to say the sizing is pretty good even though this has kind of a lower roof line compared to a lot of Crossovers and SUVs and it&#39;s not intended for maximizing passenger carrying capability with a third row and back there&#39;s decent space here I have the front seat positioned where I would sit as a pretty tall driver and I&#39;m sitting back here my knees still have several inches before they would hit the back of the front seat I have Headroom even though we have a big panoramic sunroof here which sometimes steals Headroom especially in a lower car it&#39;s just a lot of space knees head hips it all works out back here and it&#39;s a comfortable place to be and there are some nice amenities in the back as well you got rear heated seats you can turn them on in this button on the door panel as you can see you got rear climate vents back here which is also nice and rear USB C ports for plugging in and charging your devices and of course you got rear cup holders back here as well there&#39;s some integrated into the door panel on each side if you want or you can fold down this Center armrest and find more cup holders so nothing particularly exciting or cool or quirky or feury back here but a nice comfortable place to spend time and finally we move on to the cargo area in the crown signia you open up in the power tailgate and you discover a cargo area nothing particularly exciting back here although it is deep ER I longer than I expected it to be so there&#39;s decent space back here again despite the fact that this isn&#39;t some huge Mondo SUV it&#39;s got pretty good cargo sizing I will say the roof height probably does play some role in here of limiting cargo space a bit if you wanted to totally maximize and jam it packed a taller crossover would have a little bit more space but I think it does the job for most people most of the time now one interesting thing back here under the floor you don&#39;t really have any extra storage like you do in some cars but if you lift up the floor it&#39;s hinged after a few inches where there is a small little extra storage compartment where you can put small little extra items if you want to just a little bit of stuff can go back there you can lift up the floor the rest of the way but you can see there&#39;s stuff back there there&#39;s not really space where you can put any extra storage items except in that little compartment right at the front which frankly is better than nothing now also worth pointing out that back in the cargo area you have these pches you can use to drop the rear seats not power operated but that&#39;s fine and that means if you&#39;re coming up to the car with a large item you don&#39;t have to go around to each individual back seat to drop it you can just do it from the cargo area which adds some convenience of course if you want to put the seats back up you do have to do that individually at the seats themselves but it&#39;s still better than nothing in the cargo area of the crown signia all right driving the Toyota Crown signia the most aggressively anyone has ever described this vehicle um in the car World station wagon is a dirty word you don&#39;t want to say station wagon nobody wants a station wagon everybody wants a crossover you can&#39;t say station wagon even if you are offering a station wagon unless you were Subaru and then you just say Outback and then everybody gets it and they&#39;re happy this car is nice looking it&#39;s going to occupy an obscure portion of Toyota&#39;s lineup it will sell in small numbers but it drives really nicely it looks really good I think from the outside um the interior is just gorgeous in here it&#39;s priced way too high it&#39;s it&#39;s in a very thinly sliced segment I don&#39;t know why anyone would really buy this car over the Highlander to be honest and Toyota&#39;s like well it&#39;s for empty nesters they want better mileage they don&#39;t need the seats yeah but if you give someone the opportunity to have more seats for less money they&#39;re going to take it CU that H maybe we&#39;ll need it I&#39;m not sure honey don&#39;t you think yeah I would probably yeah you should just get the seats save some money like no one is going to buy this but for the few people who do they&#39;re going to be treated to actually a pretty nice experience this car is almost at the level of Lexus quality and honestly the other thing that&#39;s kind of cool about it is it&#39;s going to be a little bit more you know special and and interesting compared to a boring standard Highlander or rev 4 hybrid or whatever like those cars are everywhere there&#39;s literally one right in front of me as I&#39;m saying this now to me the biggest drawback of this car I should point out the um pricing is just is too high I mean the Venza was already not popular and it was like eight grand cheaper than this so I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find a huge I don&#39;t think the strategy is take the price and make it even higher I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s necessarily going to do it but let&#39;s talk Driving Experience a little bit uh more specifically this dri is great it&#39;s very smooth nice and comfortable um good amount of interior room in here knee room head room leg room hip room it all feels nice now it isn&#39;t fast at all I mean it really is not a fast vehicle it&#39;s it&#39;s fine it&#39;s totally adequate gets you around town gets you on the freeway no problem but but you will never win any drag races in this car but I think that&#39;s totally okay again car enthusiasts are going to be like that&#39;s slow and it is by car Enthusiast standards but for for grandparents from Calgary who want to come down uh to Palm Springs in the winter this is a great option for them great highway fuel economy and when they&#39;re back in Calgary they can still have a car to drive around their grandkids although I suspect they&#39;d rather have the seats in the Highlander it is worth out though that this car is a lot nicer than the Highlander and the reason it&#39;s more expensive is because you can get a cheaper Highlander than this but it&#39;s kind of an average lower trim Highlander this is a nice car at this price point it really is like a legitimately nice high-end car with a nice interior you&#39;re just making the trade off of seats but you&#39;re getting the great benefit of fantastic fuel economy this is still a desirable vehicle if for whatever reason it does fit into your space you want something nicer than a Rav 4 you don&#39;t need the seats on a Highlander this is that I just think that&#39;s a very thin slice of the pot population um but I also think the result of that is this car will probably be a pretty good deal on the used Market in a few years uh and maybe that&#39;s the best way to buy the crown Insignia especially if you a wagon Enthusiast you get a secret hidden Toyota wagon just make sure to call it a crossover if you ever meet any Toyota people and so that&#39;s the new 2025 Toyota Crown signia frankly I&#39;m not sure that this is something it&#39;s nice it drives reasonably well it looks good it gets great mileage it has a fantastic interior but I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s really going to buy this I like that it&#39;s sort of Toyota coming back with a wagon but they&#39;re selling it as a crossover and they already have eight others that you can choose from and they&#39;ve already cancelled the Venza twice in this segment so I&#39;m not really sure if this will actually do any better but I guess we&#39;ll find out and now it&#39;s time to give the crown signia a Doug score and the Doug score is here 47 out of 100 which places the crown signia here against some relevant cars I like the crown signia in Principle as it&#39;s effectively a Toyota wagon even though they call it a crossover but in practice it leaves me confused it replaces the slow selling Venza but it&#39;s even more expensive which I suspect will lead to even slower sales it&#39;s also more expensive than hybrid versions of the Toyota Rav 4 which offer better gas mileage and similar practicality though not the same level of luxury for luxury however you can upgrade to a Lexus NX or RX for not much more money and still keep the hybrid powertrain just with a better brand name and a nicer interior the crown signia is a legitimately nice car but it doesn&#39;t really fit in and I&#39;d probably buy one of the other options [Applause] [Music] first e"

      "subtitles": "this is Doug deuro and today we&#39;re going to talk about undervalued sports cars and what I mean by this is sports cars that are awesome or excellent or fantastic or better than their current market price suggest they should be I&#39;m not talking about cars that I think are going to shoot up in value in the future because they&#39;re underappreciated by the modern car Enthusiast I mean cars I that aren&#39;t necessarily going to become more valuable but just for the price you pay it seems to be undervalued for the experience that these cars deliver uh I haven&#39;t got this list ranked I&#39;m going to just do it alphabetically but these are the sports cars that I think are undervalued that are better than what they cost let&#39;s do [Applause] it today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has sold almost $500 million worth of cars all sorts of special interesting stuff like this and this and this and this so if you&#39;re looking to buy or sell a cool Enthusiast car do it at carsand bids.com okay starting my list of undervalued sports cars again this isn&#39;t ranked it&#39;s actually alphabetical and so I&#39;m I&#39;m going to start with the Aston Martin V8 Vantage and the DB9 the used V8 Vantage and DB9 and particularly early models from the kind of mid to late 2000s I put both of these together on this list because they actually cost about the same you can kind of have your pick between a V8 Vantage or a DB9 for around the $40,000 Mark high 30s to 40 to low to mid-40s will get you into a pretty nice V8 Vantage or DB9 I got to say that&#39;s a pretty good deal when you consider what these cars are in the case of the DB9 you get a V12 an absolutely beautiful luxury Cruiser a great sound a gorgeous car in the case of the Vantage for the same money you also get a gorgeous car a little bit less beauty and a little bit more sporty performan e tossable kind of fun Driving Experience kind of thing the Vantage is more common to find with a manual transmission the DB9 is more common automatic it&#39;s sort of a pick your poison do you want the V12 Luxury Grand Tour or the V8 kind of more sporty tossable car either way you can get them around 40 Grand and although I wouldn&#39;t normally list these vehicles as you know undervalued considering yeah they&#39;re cheap but they&#39;re unreliable the truth is that when you look on cars and bids we get these submitted to us pretty commonly with 70 80 90,000 miles on them they seem to be Fairly reliable and I know this firsthand because I owned an 06 V8 Vantage which was second first or second model year and it was pretty good I bought the car after it been sitting for a while not really being used and it had some problems at the start but then I drove it uh to 34 US states across the country and back and it was totally fine very reliable really a solid car quite an impressive vehicle actually and I got to say that&#39;s kind of been the experience of other people I know who have had these cars it&#39;s actually kind of a perfect vehicle because Aston Martin&#39;s reputation for reliability has absolutely tanked their resale value but the actual lived experience of owning these cars is a lot better than the $40,000 price tag would suggest they&#39;re beautiful gorgeous incredible to look at and not really all that expensive to buy or own it&#39;s not going to be a Toyota but it&#39;s also not as bad as you might think okay next sports car that I think is surprisingly undervalued how about the original out RS5 this is a great one the original RS5 was sold 2013 to 2015 is and it came with a 450 horsepower big old naturally aspirated V8 you can&#39;t get one of these with a manual transmission but they are beautiful cars styled by Walter D Silva an Italian who created one of some of the most beautiful cars and this was kind of his ultimate Beauty uh the RS the A5 and S5 are generally attractive but the RS5 was especially gorgeous it was also wonderfully subtle The Styling was just beautiful they didn&#39;t rely on all sorts of ugly things to make it seem cooler than it was they just went with the design big a little bigger Wheels some subtle upgrades here or there and then that 450 horse na8 under the hood and the real key is that you can pick one of these up for around $25,000 right now and that&#39;s a pretty good deal for a low production only made it for 3 years rare special car that certainly didn&#39;t continue in production in this form you know the next RS5 had a turbo V6 it was technically faster whatever but the original one with a big old V8 that&#39;s the cool one short production run beautiful car and surprisingly inexpensive and that leads me to my very next undervalued sports car which is the Audi ttrs and specifically the original ttrs that was sold in the states uh which was like 2013 145 also about that same ERA this car has a turbo 5-cylinder with 360 horsepower that is a big number for a car the size of an Audi TT uh short production run very rare car they were manual transmissions and it&#39;s an Audi RS car you know a lot of enthusiasts like to knock the Audi TT oh it&#39;s it&#39;s small and it&#39;s got the soft curvy styling it&#39;s not an aggressive sports car well this one had 360 horsepower Turbo 5 cylinder manual transmission uh this thing wet and it was really rare and really special and these days you can easily pick one up in the low $30,000 range and this car will absolutely hang with BMW z4m Coupe type Vehicles it was a very special very desirable very rare car and frankly a pretty beautiful one as well if you get past the oh it&#39;s a TT stereotypes and really look at what the TTR RS specifically is it was a very special car and I think that it&#39;s undervalued considering the experience you get the fun the speed the performance and the Rarity you&#39;re very rarely going to encounter another one on the road or at Cars and Coffee or anybody else who has one it really is a special car next one on my list of undervalued sports cars at least for the experience that you get the e82 BMW 1 Series so this was the original BMW 1 series sold from like the late 2000s up to 2015 or something like that I think that BMW has a fantastic history of making high performance little cars and even though there&#39;s been a lot of complaints that over the years BMW vehicles have grown larger and larger which is true you know the three series is now the size of the old Five series etc etc you hear those complaints BMW still stays true to their tradition of making good little cars every so often and so obviously the most famous one is the 2002 from the 1970s but then you had the e33 series in the late 80s and early 90s and I think in the 2000s they kind of brought it all back with the e821 series in the States this was only sold as a coupe or a convertible which really helped to drive home the point of the sportiness in other markets it was sold as a hatchback and with some smaller powertrains and really meant to be more of a practical car but here it was all about performance and excitement and it&#39;s a fun car it is a really thrilling car to drive in the spirit of the original old school little tossable BMWs like the 2002 and the e33 series you can pick up an e82 an early BMW e821 specifically a 135 the most powerful version that they made short of the M car you can pick up a 135 for 9 to 11,000 this is going to be an automatic with high miles but you get the point that I&#39;m making if you spend $1 or $15,000 you can get a car that&#39;s been sorted with good miles a manual transmission and really have fun and everybody talks about how e303 series models are basically impossible to come by anymore it cheap they used to be so full then people turn them into track cars or they crash them or they get destroyed or whatever and that doesn&#39;t exist anymore well I would submit that it does exist in the case of the e82 the one series is that next level of that car and it&#39;s getting down to that price point when you start talking about the 9 to $111,000 range you account for inflation and that&#39;s where e30s used to be when people were so nostalgic about finding them on Craigslist for six grand this is the e82 now I want to be clear the e82 is going to have some problems especially the 135 that motor was known to have some issues uh but that&#39;s kind of like used BMW ownership and it certainly was the case of with e30s in some ways uh and it&#39;s certainly the case of other BMWs and you just kind of go into it knowing that so you&#39;re paying the 10 to 12,000 to buy the car and you know you&#39;re going to have to do some stuff this is a car for DIY people it&#39;s a car for people who kind of want to Tinker and maybe improve performance when something breaks or when a known failure point will break but it&#39;s still a pretty good bargain car and lives up to kind of this special BMW ethos and it drives really well for $113,000 it&#39;s tossable it&#39;s fun it&#39;s fast I really enjoy the e82 okay next up on my list of undervalued performance cars this is an obvious one I talk about it all the time the C5 Chevy Corvette Z06 now before I go any further I want to point out this is true of basically any C5 Chevy Corvette and it&#39;s also true of the C5 and C6 Z6 which are both Total Bargains but when you do the VIN diagram here the the the overlap is the C5 Corvette a bargain and the Z6 C5 or C6 combine them together the C5 Z6 specifically is the bargain for those who don&#39;t know the C5 Z6 was the high performance kind of track focused version of the C5 Corvette which had come out in &#39;98 the Z6 came out a few years later and it was a special car it used its kind of its own body style that wasn&#39;t really offered on the regular Corvette it was like a true Coupee and so it has a very special look to it um with some other special upgrades like distinctive wheels and some you know inlets on the side that they were subtle but that if you knew you knew but it wasn&#39;t just that it got an improved powertrain it got a naturally aspirated V8 a little over 400 horsepower which is a big number for a car the size of the C5 and then there were all these other little subtle and sharp tweaks to improve the cornering capabilities the handling performance of this car and it really was an excellent and surprisingly good and strong track car um for steering handling it&#39;s not what you associate with &#39;90s Corvettes or &#39; 80s or 70s or 60s Corvettes but this particular car that kind of was born from the C5 of the 9s really was a fun and enjoyable car to throw around because of the upgrades that they made to it um these days $20,000 will buy you a nice C5 Z6 you can buy ratty ones in the teens and you can buy really nice ones for like 30 like super low mileage well preserved Commemorative Edition but 20 grand will buy you a decent car with like a couple of M maybe a minor accident and reasonable miles you know 50,000 miles and that&#39;s a car you can really have a great time with and the fun part is you can drive it you can enjoy it you can throw it around and and kind of track it yourself and then you can sell it for pretty much what you paid because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been going for for a long time so it&#39;s an experience you can really enjoy and not really put all that much money into um they&#39;re reliable they&#39;re good they&#39;re fun to drive and I really like that car okay next one this is an obvious one another one I&#39;ve been talking about for a long time and various videos similar to this the original Dodge Viper rt10 so that was the very first Viper that was sold from &#39;92 to 9596 the original vipers were sold with those famous three-spoke Wheels no real Windows no real roof um it was a very raw Automotive experience and you can pick one up these days for maybe $35 to $50,000 for a nice one which you might think sounds like a lot of money for a used Dodge but manual transmission naturally aspirated V10 and most importantly a true exotic car experience like when I I had the second gen Viper which cost a little bit more but when I would go and drive that thing around people would just freak out they would get so excited to see a Viper especially an old Viper on the road and it it&#39;s not unlike when I drive around my like crazy exotic cars these days I got a Lamborghini Countach that that gets more attention but not not 10 times more considering the value is 10 times higher these These Old vipers are really special EX cars and even beyond the attention they&#39;re just fun they&#39;re big engines mounted to a chassis and then there was some Bodywork thrown on top and they&#39;re very raw cars they&#39;re cars where you need a garage because they don&#39;t they they leak on the inside because they don&#39;t really have a roof and windows um they kind of have temporary solutions for that stuff they they&#39;re not the most usable cars which is why I think that values haven&#39;t really taken off I think people look at them and say you know that&#39;s cool but unless you live in Southern California or Arizona in the spring and fall places where it&#39;s dry and warm you&#39;re not really going to be able to use the car and so I don&#39;t see the Viper shooting up in value but I do see the experience being undervalued considering what it offers it is just so cool and so exciting and so much fun okay next up in terms of undervalued sports cars cars that offer more than their price tag would suggest next one maybe this is too easy or obvious but the ND Mazda Miata I&#39;ve never been a massive Miata guy there some people who are really obset with them I&#39;m more of a generalist I like the na and the NB and the NC just fine but for me the ND which is the current most recent Mazda Miata came out 10 years ago now back in 2015 that is just the most exciting and enjoyable and wondrous car I love how the ND Miata looks I love how it drives I love how it feels I love how it handles and I love that they were able to bring back the spirit of like the original Little kind of lightweight Miata while still including modern features that you would expect and wrapping it in this absolutely gorgeous package it is not the fastest car in the world and in order to make it a really excellent great experience you kind of have to get a later one they got more power they added a folding hard top which I think makes it look better and more usable but then you start to lose the value proposition the early ND Miatas which came out for the 16 model year um you can get a cheap one for around $15,000 and around 20 will get you a really decent one with a manual transmission and low mileage and a lot of fun and I don&#39;t want to say that&#39;s a lot of car for the money because it&#39;s not in terms of horsepower and performance but it is a really nice experience for that price point and again a very slow depreciation curve they did not make a ton of ND Mias you know interest in that segment has not been as strong as it was when the Miata first came out 30 years ago um and so it&#39;s been a little bit rarer to find especially a manual well equipped not over modified not crashed and for 20 grand that gets you a nice one you probably own that five or six years and sell it for not too much less than that and really get a nice experience out of it now again you&#39;re not going to have the experience of throwing it around and really flooring it and getting great power out accelerating everybody from a stoplight but you will have a really great steering and handling experience in a really nice looking car and you can look at yourself and say you know for 20 grand this gives me a lot of the Thrills that people get in exotic cars that cost way more just sort of without the ego component right nobody&#39;s ever going to look at an ND and say whoa man that&#39;s a cool car but you can have the same experience and frankly I think that&#39;s that&#39;s just as enjoyable for a lot of people it&#39;s really a nice car it&#39;s really a lot of fun to own to drive to exist with and I really love the ND okay next up on my list of undervalued sports cars for the experience they provide this one is obvious and it doesn&#39;t get discussed enough but the Nissan 350Z the one that came out back at 0 3 is a really really undervalued car considering all that it offers um the 03z came out with about 300 horsepower initially it was just shy and later it was boosted to right about 300 horsepower um they are easy to find there&#39;s a lot of them around they&#39;re easy to find manual transmissions a lot of them were made um it has a very reliable powertrain that is very easy to own to operate to tune to modify and to find parts for that VQ V6 engine and you could find one pretty easily for around $110,000 and that is just a total bargain especially when you consider that the previous model the z32 which was sold from like the early 90s 96 97 um nice versions of that car are big money $4 $50,000 for really well-kept nice ones the 350Z has never really earned that classic car status where values start to rise and it starts to appreciate and so it never really got expensive or valuable um and there are still even nice ones to this day are not really that much more than around $10,000 for a fun tossable powerful this is actually a car that even by today&#39;s standard still feels fast and exciting and Powerful um reliable sports car and I think it looks cool and I think it still kind of turns heads and I think someday you will see some of that value appreciation and excitement for these cars especially nice ones kept in good shape but right now enjoy the bargain while you can it really is a surprisingly good deal and finally my last undervalued sports car that delivers more than it should for the price this is an obvious one been talking about this for years the 996 Porsche 911 the Porsche 911 that was sold from 1999 to 2005 give or take um these are really fun cars it&#39;s it&#39;s your ability to get into a Porsche 911 without spending 80 90 $100,000 like so many older 911s now cost um those old 911s are are kind of gone from a lot of enthusiasts who want the Porsche experience and so the question is well how can I get into a 911 you know every Enthusiast kind of asked themselves that question at one point and the answer is a 996 which is still a very affordable car early automatic transmission 996 911s are in the low teens 1334 15 $15,000 but even if you want a manual round 20 buys you a cheap manual 996 911 and 30 $30,000 buys you a really nice one like a good it&#39;ll be a two- wheel drive narrow body car car mov some miles but like no bad Carfax later model not modified like a nice good 996 $30,000 of will buy that for you and that&#39;s a pretty good number to get into a 911 when you look at the fact that earlier cars even regular ones are in the $ 60 $70,000 range that&#39;s getting out of reach for a lot of enthusiasts if you&#39;ve ever wanted to scratch that 911 inch yeah it&#39;s just the 996 but it still drives fantastically it&#39;s still a wonderful car to own and operate and use you know the 911 that came before the 996 was the 993 which everybody is so obsessed with such a special car and it really is but the 996 was the successor the later version for a reason it was more powerful it was just as enjoyable to drive it&#39;s really a very very exciting car it just doesn&#39;t look as good it wasn&#39;t as reliable and they made far more and so production numbers have made it less rare and a little bit less special in terms of buying it but I think a really nice 996 and especially one that&#39;s been well sorted with the Ms issue taken care of is a really good bargain even still today and I think that&#39;s especially true when you look at what&#39;s happened to older 911 values and you start to wonder if that market is is going to completely slip away from you if you want to make a purchase and just take a bite out of the 911 world having a 996 is a special way to do it regardless of what Porsche purists tell you they&#39;ll complain about the water cooled the interior quality the look of the headlights it&#39;s all stupid when you&#39;re behind the wheel it is a fun enjoyable tossable fast exciting car to drive with great driver inputs pedal steering brake it&#39;s just a great car and um they had a little bit of a moment right after Co that the prices started to rise and I started to think hey this is it the 996 is finally going to start to become a really valuable car the enthusiasts the collectors are starting to latch on and then it kind of dropped off the the balloon deflated and 996 values came right back down and they&#39;re still affordable and I&#39;m not sure how much longer that&#39;s going to last as more of these get modified as more engines blow up um a lot of automatics out there a lot of people doing Safari builds like it&#39;s going to become harder and harder to find a nice 996 in the future and so if you want to do it at some point soon get into a 911 this is your chance to do it without spending crazy money so those are my undervalued sports cars again I don&#39;t necessarily think all of these are going to shoot up in value over the years but I do think all of them give more of an experience than you would expect considering what they cost all of these cars are special fun and exciting and surprisingly affordable uh considering how enjoyable they are at various different price points I really like all of the cars on this list some more maintenance intensive than others but all of them are a really good bargain for what they deliver to the car enthusiast [Applause] [Music]"
