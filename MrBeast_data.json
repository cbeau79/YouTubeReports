            "subtitles": "In this video, we are building\nand giving away of 100 houses, and each home is going to change\na family&#39;s life. Like this family\nwho didn&#39;t have a house to call their own. And they have no idea\nwe just built them one. Take off your blindfolds and turn around. Behind you is your brand new home. Oh, I was not expecting that reaction. She is freaking out. There&#39;s a bedroom!!! I&#39;ve always wanted him to have a bunk bed. And my dream come true. This is actually just the first\nof 100 houses we&#39;re giving away. First? I&#39;m glad they&#39;re happy. Let&#39;s go give away another house. With every single home\nwe&#39;re building in this video, we&#39;re improving quality of life\nfor families who don&#39;t have a safe space to call home. And we spend millions of dollars just on this video building these houses. Because here in Jamaica, there are\ncurrently over half a million people living in unsafe,\nlife-threatening conditions. Like this next family whose house is so unsafe\nand unstable it could collapse on them at any moment. - So you built this place?\n- Yeah. - By yourself?\n- Yeah. I brought boards\nand all materials that you see. But we&#39;re on top of a mountain. So you carried all this material\nup this mountain? - Yep.\n- On my head. We knew we wanted to build\nthis family a house. So we sent them on a trip\nso that we had enough time to work with our partners\nto build them a brand new home. You&#39;re about to witness a family\nthat lives in this house, go to living in this house. And I cannot wait to see\nthe look on their faces. Oh my. What you&#39;re looking at\nis your brand new home. The trip we sent you guys on\nwas just a decoy so we can have time to build\nthis brand new house for you. Do you want to see the inside? Come check it out. We noticed that\nyou might need some new furniture, so we completely furnished your new place. Now, on top of the electricity, you have a water tank for running water. We put bunk beds in this room\nfor two of the kids. Oh my. And if you go across the hallway,\nyou&#39;ll see your bedroom. - Nice.\n- With a little crib. Because I heard you had a newborn. Tyra, that&#39;s your crib. It&#39;s been really hard.\nAnd you guys changed my life. Here&#39;s officially the deed to the house. Thank you guys so much. And it&#39;s unfortunate,\nbut some of the places these families live are extremely unsafe\nand in some cases, life threatening. That&#39;s where this family currently lives. The mom was telling us that\nthat roof doesn&#39;t work. Whenever the rainfall,\nwhole place flooded all over here. Her kids get soaked and can&#39;t sleep. And as of today,\nthat will not happen again. We built that brand new home for you. - Here&#39;s the keys.\n- Oh my God. I got a new house. But of course we couldn&#39;t stop there and we were able to build a home\nafter home for families in Jamaica. And we weren&#39;t going to stop\nuntil we had built 100 houses. But unfortunately, at our next\ndestination, there&#39;s a river that destroys hundreds\nof homes every year. During rainy season, this river flash\nfloods washing away all of the homes and anyone unlucky\nenough to still be inside. And as you can see, there&#39;s literally a fridge right there, which I assume got there\nbecause their house got swept away. Exactly. So you&#39;re saying when this floods\nthose houses that currently have families\nliving in them are going to be destroyed by this river? Yes, they will. Well, not on my watch\nbecause just a couple miles away, we&#39;ve built rows of new houses\nfor this community. No joke. We&#39;re giving away this home,\nthis home, this home, this home, this home,\nthis home, this home, this home. There&#39;s a lot of homes. So we started with Maria and her daughter, whose previous home was\ncompletely demolished by the river and during rainy season. And without even a bed to sleep in, every single\nday has been a struggle for them. God has helped me to stay strong. All right, since they don&#39;t speak English, Can you translate for them to turn around\nand look at your brand new home? Can you turn around? Here is your new house. Oh my God. - Thank you.\n- Thank you my beautiful God! Mommy! - Thank you.\n- No problem. Come check out the inside.\nOh, you want to give me a hug? Come on. Oh! How beautiful! And while walking through their new home, we realized they didn&#39;t even\nknow the house was free yet. - Oh, you haven&#39;t told them it&#39;s free?\n- No, no. - Yeah. Tell them. It&#39;s free.\n- You&#39;re not gonna pay. All of this is yours. Thank you god! Congrats on your new home. You&#39;re crazy for not\ntelling them it was free. - Can I lay down? -\n- Yes, you can lay down. I&#39;m going to sleep. What do you think of it? - Can I give you a hug?\n- What&#39;d she say? - Can she hug you?\n- Of course. Thank you! This is why we do videos like that. - Look how happy they are.\n- I appreciate this with all of my heart. I don&#39;t want you to have to worry\nabout the river anymore. This is your brand new home. Enjoy the new home, little man. We heard they had a newborn,\nso we also got him a crib. Son, we have a house. See that row of houses behind me with the family&#39;s\nblindfolded in front of them? We are not kidnaping the families. We&#39;re giving them all houses\nat the same time. Eight families\nlives are about to change forever. Attention everybody. Remove your blindfolds and turn around and look at your brand new home. Congratulations! For real? It’s free? Thank you for the house, Jimmy! I got to go down.\nI need to see the reactions. - What do you think of the new place?\n- Thank you. Congrats. Can you ask them\nif they like their new house? - Do you like your new house?\n- Yes! Yeah. You like the new house? Let&#39;s see if they do.\nWhat do you think of it? - Very beautiful! Thank you!\n- Thank you! I hope you like it.\nAnd now we&#39;re at the end of the row. - What do you think of your new home?\n- Very good. Can I get a picture? Yeah, come over here. I have something way\nbetter than just a picture. Can you ask him if he\nwants to play football with me? Wanna play soccer with him? - Yeah.\n- Well, that&#39;s convenient because... not only are we giving\nthis community houses, but we&#39;re also giving them\nthis giant soccer field. And the best part is, I have\nhundreds of kids waiting over here. We&#39;re going to surprise them. And this is the neighborhood&#39;s first\nlook at their brand new soccer field. Let&#39;s play some soccer. Enjoy your new soccer field. Go have fun. And of course, a new field had to come with brand new soccer equipment\nfor all the kids. Make sure you guys have a lot of fun\non the soccer field. But I don&#39;t know\nif the soccer field was enough because all of the kids\nstarted demanding Feastables. Feastables! All right, here&#39;s some Feastables. They really love Feastables here.\nI will start carrying more Feastables. Feastables is better than Hershey&#39;s! I don&#39;t know what he said, but if you said it tastes good\nthat he&#39;s correct. But of course, outside of this community, more families across El Salvador\nwere in need of safe houses. So on our way out, we built\nas many houses as we possibly could, but we&#39;re only halfway there\nbecause a small community in Argentina needed our help, and we built house after house\nto ensure that every single child in this community\nhad a safe place to learn and grow. But we still weren&#39;t done. So we even flew all the way over\nto Mexico, where we continued to build house after house\nfor all of these communities. And when we arrived\nin our next destination in Colombia, we found a community whose homes\nwere ravaged by a brutal windstorm. The next family used to live\nin a house like this. I say used to\nbecause a tornado destroyed it. And clearly\nthese houses are in no way livable. And so of course we built John\nand Ana a brand new home. And now all we have to do\nis give it to them. This family has no idea they&#39;re\nabout to get that house. Right there is good. Okay, take them off. Congrats. I know it might not seem real,\nbut this is legitimately your house. You want to unlock the front door? They&#39;re all in shock. And to be honest, I don&#39;t even think\nthey believe this is their house. They may not be saying anything,\nbut the tears say a lot. Congrats man. Congrats. This is yours. It&#39;s so big. It’s so big! Before, we only had a\nhalf finished room! We have a home! We have a home! But John and Ana weren&#39;t the only ones\nthat needed help in Colombia. So you probably already know What we did\nfor the rest of this community. Don&#39;t you love it? Look at that smile. It shouldn&#39;t be a stretch\nthat everyone in the world deserves a safe roof over their head. But not every house we built\nwent quite so smoothly. I accidentally broke the lock to the door. Their furniture&#39;s still outside,\nwhich we are going to move in there. The family just pulled up. We put bars on the\nwindow so I can&#39;t get in. - I don&#39;t really know what to do.\n- We&#39;re very screwed. All right guys, the family&#39;s here.\nIt looks like we&#39;re out of time. No way! Are you serious? Hey, how&#39;s it going? Come on over. Okay, so, I don&#39;t know,\nI think I broke the lock. I can&#39;t get the door open. Here, can you try? Maybe I&#39;m just dumb. Oh, what? Wait, how&#39;d you do that? Are we dumb? All right boys, come on in. And while personally,\nI&#39;m not quite the best locksmith... Do you want to see it? They totally haven&#39;t\nseen any of the furniture yet. What mattered most is that Jose and\nhis family now had a place to call home. You don&#39;t have to worry\nabout a home anymore. And we also heard their only means\nof transportation broke down. And so, one more surprise. We also got you guys\na brand new motorcycle. Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you.\n- No problem. Yeah. Now they have a brand new home\nand way to get around. And this got me thinking. While giving away all these houses, I noticed a lot of people were\nstruggling with transportation. And I got a solve in this truck. Open it up. We got bicycles for every single\none of the kids in this village. - Thank you, MrBeast.\n- No problem, man. - Thank you, MrBeast!\n- Thank you, MrBeast! After all of these houses\nwe built in Colombia, we still had one home left to give away. And finally, house 100. Take your blindfolds off\nand look at your new home. - Thank you!\n- Congrats. - Oh, congrats.\n- Thank you very much. Go check it out. Shout out to all our partners\nthat helped build these houses. And also shout out to you guys because obviously\nif you didn&#39;t watch these videos, we wouldn&#39;t\nhave been able to build 100 houses. And if the channel continues to grow,\nI hope to do 1000 in the future."

            "subtitles": "I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you&#39;re ready, Mack. First jump, he&#39;s about to do it. Oh my God, I&#39;m so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he&#39;s doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don&#39;t know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There&#39;s double swinging hammers \nand it&#39;s the longest distance. You have this. I don&#39;t know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand&#39;s on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It&#39;s scary for me and \nI&#39;m on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don&#39;t celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let&#39;s go to the next one. Can&#39;t get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don&#39;t know. The answer is no, because we&#39;re not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We&#39;re going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn&#39;t supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he&#39;s\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can&#39;t go back. Let&#39;s see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don&#39;t look down. There&#39;s no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don&#39;t fall Please don&#39;t fall. \nPlease don&#39;t fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money&#39;s over here. Keep going. Oh, this one&#39;s way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you&#39;re almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don&#39;t do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one&#39;s a big one. It&#39;s a big one. He&#39;s right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don&#39;t fall. \nHe&#39;s so close. Oh, my gosh! If you&#39;re wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he&#39;s actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He&#39;s been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I&#39;m giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you&#39;re pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou&#39;ll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you&#39;ll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here&#39;s a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It&#39;ll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he&#39;s off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don’t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn&#39;t have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don&#39;t want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you&#39;re not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don&#39;t blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don&#39;t need that.\n- And you&#39;re still at the start. I don&#39;t need that. Mack, you&#39;ve basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there&#39;s more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won&#39;t explode the money? I&#39;m not confident. - Okay. \n- And you&#39;re going to do it anyways? I&#39;m kind of confident. He&#39;s getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you&#39;re questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe&#39;re not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don&#39;t know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It&#39;s not worth it. It&#39;s not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven&#39;t gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it&#39;s... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it&#39;s up to you. Oh, you&#39;re going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn&#39;t for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it&#39;s time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt&#39;s just you. - Godspeed. \n- It&#39;s you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it&#39;s coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there&#39;s a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there&#39;s 10 seconds left. Wait, I don&#39;t know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There’s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I&#39;m so happy he&#39;s not picking me up. Oh you&#39;re right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I&#39;m being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet&#39;s head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit&#39;s going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn&#39;t in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That&#39;s a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don&#39;t drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don&#39;t let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it&#39;s a good thing he&#39;s holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we&#39;re going to be here all night.\nBut I don&#39;t want to be. So it&#39;s about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you&#39;re\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon&#39;t need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don&#39;t\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don&#39;t drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that&#39;s available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There&#39;s only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I&#39;m going to show him how it&#39;s done. This is how it&#39;s done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I&#39;m probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I&#39;m definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn&#39;t sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let&#39;s just say\nthey didn&#39;t do too hot. I&#39;m never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don&#39;t want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We&#39;re going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn&#39;t grab on to that\nthird ball. We&#39;ve been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon&#39;t drop that bar. I&#39;m not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let&#39;s go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It&#39;s not getting harder than that. You can&#39;t lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we&#39;re doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can&#39;t see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What&#39;s.\nWhat&#39;s going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren&#39;t even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you&#39;ll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What&#39;s going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There&#39;s no way.\n- We&#39;re doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I&#39;m not gonna lie.\nI&#39;m kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren&#39;t scared of it. Oh my gosh. We’re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What&#39;s wrong? I feel like I&#39;m about to\nlose all this again, dude. I&#39;m... Just don&#39;t fall. This exact thing. I couldn&#39;t even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there&#39;s three of them,\nand we&#39;re 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you&#39;re just stalling\nbecause you&#39;re afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let&#39;s see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you&#39;re ready. There&#39;s only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I&#39;m going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven&#39;t told Mack\nis as long as you&#39;ve made it across. You&#39;re free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you&#39;re feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn&#39;t see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You&#39;re coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you&#39;re doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it&#39;s not... No, I&#39;m doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob&#39;s a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I&#39;m going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won&#39;t sleep for three. Let&#39;s go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou&#39;ll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that&#39;s a lot of flavor. That&#39;s a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That&#39;s it. I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s\nactually them. - That&#39;s four.\n- I can&#39;t believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let&#39;s do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That&#39;s the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn&#39;t\nmake it across. He&#39;s back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let&#39;s bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he&#39;s off.\nHe&#39;s off. Take a second, bro.\nYou&#39;re good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let&#39;s bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don&#39;t fall. All right. Okay. I&#39;m coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money&#39;s on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We&#39;re not done yet, baby. Come on! Don&#39;t celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I&#39;m not messing this up again. And now it&#39;s time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn&#39;t blame you\nif you&#39;re terrified at this course. And because you&#39;ve been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don&#39;t even know \nwhat I&#39;m going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you&#39;re going to say. I&#39;m not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I&#39;m going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here&#39;s the cookie. \n- I&#39;m not accepting it. At least not yet. I&#39;ve had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that&#39;s sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won&#39;t be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let&#39;s get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we&#39;re off. He did it! That&#39;s only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don&#39;t look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They&#39;re down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We&#39;re still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don&#39;t take your hand off. That&#39;s freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you&#39;re going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you&#39;re shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there&#39;s\nno shot he&#39;s... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I&#39;m doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That’s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You&#39;re now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn&#39;t resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere&#39;s no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn&#39;t hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let&#39;s see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don&#39;t let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it&#39;s\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack&#39;s reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it&#39;s\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He&#39;s swinging a lot. Don&#39;t swing for too long, Mack. You&#39;re gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There&#39;s some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You&#39;re in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He&#39;s off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we&#39;re on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack&#39;s entire life. The umbrella. It&#39;s do or die. \nHe&#39;s either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family&#39;s rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can&#39;t breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he&#39;s about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He&#39;s so far away from that cookie. - I can&#39;t watch this.\n- I can&#39;t breathe. Just so you know,\nthere&#39;s 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don&#39;t know what to say. I&#39;m such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I&#39;ve got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don&#39;t have a lot of money. I&#39;m gonna make sure they don&#39;t worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life&#39;s changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It&#39;s changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I&#39;ve never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man."
