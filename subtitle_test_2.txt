power they what their position nuclear power they what their position nuclear power they what their position is it's probably the cleanest safest is it's probably the cleanest safest is it's probably the cleanest safest form of electricity that we could form of electricity that we could form of electricity that we could generate and that the fears of nuclear generate and that the fears of nuclear generate and that the fears of nuclear power are really about a few disasters power are really about a few disasters power are really about a few disasters the Fukushima through Mile Island um the Fukushima through Mile Island um the Fukushima through Mile Island um that that these These are old systems that that these These are old systems that that these These are old systems and that they could they're much more and that they could they're much more and that they could they're much more capable now and they're cap making even capable now and they're cap making even capable now and
