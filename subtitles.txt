you had a paper starting with the you had a paper starting with the you had a paper starting with the question why Eurasia point there is that question why Eurasia point there is that question why Eurasia point there is that if you look at the last 10,000 years or if you look at the last 10,000 years or if you look at the last 10,000 years or whatever the technological military Edge whatever the technological military Edge whatever the technological military Edge it hasn't always been in Europe but it it hasn't always been in Europe but it it hasn't always been in Europe but it has always been somewhere in EUR Asia has always been somewhere in EUR Asia has always been somewhere in EUR Asia the rise of Europe is relatively recent the rise of Europe is relatively recent the rise of Europe is relatively recent thing in human history for the most part thing in human history for the most part thing in human history for the most part of time past 10,000 years the wealthiest of time past 10,000 years the wealthiest of time past 10,000 years the wealthiest part of the world were Middle East and part of the world were Middle East and part of the world were Middle East and China most of the human trade happen China most of the human trade happen China most of the human trade happen between these regions so the why Russia between these regions so the why Russia between these regions so the why Russia question is try to look at what factor question is try to look at what factor question is try to look at what factor contributed to earlier rise of contributed to earlier rise of contributed to earlier rise of agriculture in eura and particularly agriculture in eura and particularly agriculture in eura and particularly look at the question that Jared dond look at the question that Jared dond look at the question that Jared dond first talked about in his magnificent first talked about in his magnificent first talked about in his magnificent book gun JS and steel which was the fact book gun JS and steel which was the fact book gun JS and steel which was the fact that uro was particularly well and all that uro was particularly well and all that uro was particularly well and all with theable species particularly with theable species particularly with theable species particularly animals so I was trying to figure out animals so I was trying to figure out animals so I was trying to figure out why that was the case what were why that was the case what were why that was the case what were Diamond's answers Diamond has a really Diamond's answers Diamond has a really Diamond's answers Diamond has a really good summary once sent us summary of his good summary once sent us summary of his good summary once sent us summary of his book which is that differences in my book which is that differences in my book which is that differences in my population with regard to the population with regard to the population with regard to the development is rooted in differences in development is rooted in differences in development is rooted in differences in environment and not on genetic or environment and not on genetic or environment and not on genetic or biological differences between biological differences between biological differences between population and he goes through his book population and he goes through his book population and he goes through his book which he tries to explain in the book which he tries to explain in the book which he tries to explain in the book why descendant of uran civilization why descendant of uran civilization why descendant of uran civilization Europeans particularly dominated the Europeans particularly dominated the Europeans particularly dominated the rest of the world after 1500 uh it's a rest of the world after 1500 uh it's a rest of the world after 1500 uh it's a task that before him Alfred Crosby has task that before him Alfred Crosby has task that before him Alfred Crosby has done in another book called eological done in another book called eological done in another book called eological imperialism sh the main difference imperialism sh the main difference imperialism sh the main difference between eura and other continents that between eura and other continents that between eura and other continents that they highlighted is the difference in they highlighted is the difference in they highlighted is the difference in animal population particularly animals animal population particularly animals animal population particularly animals that have the trait that IAD for human that have the trait that IAD for human that have the trait that IAD for human domestication of species those animals domestication of species those animals domestication of species those animals like PE cow sheep you know later horse like PE cow sheep you know later horse like PE cow sheep you know later horse donkeys and all of those tamils they donkeys and all of those tamils they donkeys and all of those tamils they really contributed to the productivity really contributed to the productivity really contributed to the productivity of Agriculture and they were they were of Agriculture and they were they were of Agriculture and they were they were you know source of wealth as Surplus you know source of wealth as Surplus you know source of wealth as Surplus those animals the her animals so it those animals the her animals so it those animals the her animals so it allows for wealth accommodation at a allows for wealth accommodation at a allows for wealth accommodation at a scale that wasn't possible in the scale that wasn't possible in the scale that wasn't possible in the absence of those animals but it comes to absence of those animals but it comes to absence of those animals but it comes to the you know later particularly European the you know later particularly European the you know later particularly European colonization and why Europeans so in a colonization and why Europeans so in a colonization and why Europeans so in a really short amount of time were able to really short amount of time were able to really short amount of time were able to colonize America with the differences colonize America with the differences colonize America with the differences that they cause in terms of disease that they cause in terms of disease that they cause in terms of disease environment and the fact that indigenous environment and the fact that indigenous environment and the fact that indigenous population of the America were like population of the America were like population of the America were like pretty much the Fess against European pretty much the Fess against European pretty much the Fess against European pathogens almost all of the Eurasian pathogens almost all of the Eurasian pathogens almost all of the Eurasian epidemic diseases that you know epidemic diseases that you know epidemic diseases that you know infectious pathogen at some point infectious pathogen at some point infectious pathogen at some point originated from animals and they adopted originated from animals and they adopted originated from animals and they adopted to humans we can think of CO as to humans we can think of CO as to humans we can think of CO as something kind of similar process and something kind of similar process and something kind of similar process and not just that it was the fact that dense not just that it was the fact that dense not just that it was the fact that dense population lived in Cross proximity to population lived in Cross proximity to population lived in Cross proximity to animals in many areas of eura which animals in many areas of eura which animals in many areas of eura which provided the opportunity for those provided the opportunity for those provided the opportunity for those pathogens to junk in a sense to human so pathogens to junk in a sense to human so pathogens to junk in a sense to human so yeah like I think theable animals and yeah like I think theable animals and yeah like I think theable animals and her animals contributed a lot to the her animals contributed a lot to the her animals contributed a lot to the differences in disas en b between old differences in disas en b between old differences in disas en b between old world and new world what about the other world and new world what about the other world and new world what about the other part of Diamond's explanation because um part of Diamond's explanation because um part of Diamond's explanation because um he says that there are two things one is he says that there are two things one is he says that there are two things one is this whole business about domestication this whole business about domestication this whole business about domestication and Eurasia for whatever reason being and Eurasia for whatever reason being and Eurasia for whatever reason being the first to start domesticating animals the first to start domesticating animals the first to start domesticating animals and and and plants taking in more and and and plants taking in more and and and plants taking in more calories from these domesticated plants calories from these domesticated plants calories from these domesticated plants and animals having the animals that and animals having the animals that and animals having the animals that leads into the germs is is a nice leads into the germs is is a nice leads into the germs is is a nice addition to that but there is another addition to that but there is another addition to that but there is another part of his argument which is that part of his argument which is that part of his argument which is that Eurasia is first of all really big and Eurasia is first of all really big and Eurasia is first of all really big and secondly it's an East West super secondly it's an East West super secondly it's an East West super continent you know there are no Silk continent you know there are no Silk continent you know there are no Silk Roads from Mexico to Peru Roads from Mexico to Peru Roads from Mexico to Peru um because you have to go through so um because you have to go through so um because you have to go through so many different climatic zones when many different climatic zones when many different climatic zones when you're moving south to North um whereas you're moving south to North um whereas you're moving south to North um whereas when you're moving to east to west you when you're moving to east to west you when you're moving to east to west you can move in relatively similar climatic can move in relatively similar climatic can move in relatively similar climatic zones which leads into I mean SE crows zones which leads into I mean SE crows zones which leads into I mean SE crows is just the kind of catch word for this is just the kind of catch word for this is just the kind of catch word for this incredible amount of constant you know incredible amount of constant you know incredible amount of constant you know movement of ideas between the the East movement of ideas between the the East movement of ideas between the the East and the West for the lack of a better and the West for the lack of a better and the West for the lack of a better work and um and the reason that I I work and um and the reason that I I work and um and the reason that I I think that some people might say that think that some people might say that think that some people might say that this is the more important part of of this is the more important part of of this is the more important part of of Diamond's answer is that the the germs Diamond's answer is that the the germs Diamond's answer is that the the germs were were were very very I mean it devastating for the very very I mean it devastating for the very very I mean it devastating for the Native Americans but then when when Native Americans but then when when Native Americans but then when when Europeans also did a pretty thorough job Europeans also did a pretty thorough job Europeans also did a pretty thorough job at colonizing Africa and there the at colonizing Africa and there the at colonizing Africa and there the disease environment was certainly not in disease environment was certainly not in disease environment was certainly not in European favor and so in a sense the I European favor and so in a sense the I European favor and so in a sense the I guess the argument there would be that guess the argument there would be that guess the argument there would be that the one thing that really happened to be the one thing that really happened to be the one thing that really happened to be kind of culminating in Europe around kind of culminating in Europe around kind of culminating in Europe around those critical year 1500 or whatnot was those critical year 1500 or whatnot was those critical year 1500 or whatnot was the fact that you just happen to have a the fact that you just happen to have a the fact that you just happen to have a lot of inventions especially military lot of inventions especially military lot of inventions especially military inventions but also information Tech inventions but also information Tech inventions but also information Tech technology inventions you know technology inventions you know technology inventions you know everything

actually this this idea and there is actually this this idea and there is actually this this this this flow of ideas that the East this this flow of ideas that the East this this flow of ideas that the East West orientation allows might be the West orientation allows might be the West orientation allows might be the most important explanation because it most important explanation because it most important explanation because it doesn't only allow us to explain what doesn't only allow us to explain what doesn't only allow us to explain what happened in the Americas but also what happened in the Americas but also what happened in the Americas but also what happens later in in in in in Africa for happens later in in in in in Africa for happens later in in in in in Africa for example yeah I think those Continental example yeah I think those Continental example yeah I think those Continental geography Factor really important I geography Factor really important I geography Factor really important I don't think they're as important as don't think they're as important as don't think they're as important as Diamond portray them so I think what is Diamond portray them so I think what is Diamond portray them so I think what is lacking from Diamond theory is the fact lacking from Diamond theory is the fact lacking from Diamond theory is the fact that when compare continents yes like that when compare continents yes like that when compare continents yes like you know a lot of the things that he you know a lot of the things that he you know a lot of the things that he said Des great but again that there's a said Des great but again that there's a said Des great but again that there's a lot of variation inside uratio that is lot of variation inside uratio that is lot of variation inside uratio that is really important perhaps even more really important perhaps even more really important perhaps even more important than Continental differences important than Continental differences important than Continental differences uh big chunk of interesting differences uh big chunk of interesting differences uh big chunk of interesting differences happened within Eurasia and that's where happened within Eurasia and that's where happened within Eurasia and that's where my research coming because on what my research coming because on what my research coming because on what Diamond attribute to Eurasian negation Diamond attribute to Eurasian negation Diamond attribute to Eurasian negation it was only happen happening in the it was only happen happening in the it was only happen happening in the southern part of uraia but no latitudes southern part of uraia but no latitudes southern part of uraia but no latitudes of uraia were particularly well endowed of uraia were particularly well endowed of uraia were particularly well endowed with domesticable animals so a theory of with domesticable animals so a theory of with domesticable animals so a theory of explaining the rise of Ira should explaining the rise of Ira should explaining the rise of Ira should explain not only Continental differences explain not only Continental differences explain not only Continental differences but why what was it about the low but why what was it about the low but why what was it about the low latitudes of Heria the southern stretch latitudes of Heria the southern stretch latitudes of Heria the southern stretch from pretty much Turkey to China that from pretty much Turkey to China that from pretty much Turkey to China that was particularly conducive to was particularly conducive to was particularly conducive to domestication and agriculture that is my domestication and agriculture that is my domestication and agriculture that is my focus so trying to complement Diamond focus so trying to complement Diamond focus so trying to complement Diamond story and trying to figure out what was story and trying to figure out what was story and trying to figure out what was it about that region so um we have the it about that region so um we have the it about that region so um we have the question why you raged and you say that question why you raged and you say that question why you raged and you say that it's it's important to notice that one it's it's important to notice that one it's it's important to notice that one thing is that animals play a big part in thing is that animals play a big part in thing is that animals play a big part in this early start of Agriculture and the this early start of Agriculture and the this early start of Agriculture and the importance of domesticated animals this importance of domesticated animals this importance of domesticated animals this is not something that happens everywhere is not something

Africa and Eurasia suggestion is that Africa and Eurasia had the plants for example that were for had the plants for example that were for had the plants for example that were for a long time probably being consumed by a long time probably being consumed by a long time probably being consumed by humans and unlike America but then humans and unlike America but then humans and unlike America but then Eurasia unlike Africa because it did Eurasia unlike Africa because it did Eurasia unlike Africa because it did start having um the the megap fora big start having um the the megap fora big start
