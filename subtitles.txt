if you&#39;re a brand new white belt you&#39;ve probably gone to training and found yourself stuck in a position that you didn&#39;t understand the objective for what am I supposed to do here what is the objective of this what do I do next well if that&#39;s you I got you covered I think you&#39;re going to find this video really helpful I wish I would have had something like this for my first few months of Jiu Jitsu so without further gun bumping let&#39;s jump in [Music] keep in mind this is a basic overview for brand new white belts we&#39;re not getting into anything that would be considered Advanced or even semi-advanced things like K guard spider guard rubber Guard we&#39;re not covering those we&#39;re covering the very Basics the foundational positions that you need to learn and understand is a white belt even as someone who came to jiu jitsu with a wrestling background I did not understand the objectives to every position what am I supposed to do when I&#39;m out my opponent what am I supposed to do when I have in my garden are these defensive positions are these offensive positions and I guarantee you that I&#39;m not the only one that&#39;s felt that way remembering that this was part of my white belt Journey has inspired me to shoot this video so I hope that it can help a few of you so jumping in with the first position we&#39;re talking about guard now you&#39;re either going to be in my guard or I will be in your garden one is offensive and one is defensive if you are in my guard I&#39;m playing offense and an easy way to remember this is because I have four limbs in the fight compared to your two limbs in the fight as you progress through your Jiu Jitsu Journey you will learn to use your legs just as much if not more than your arms people who are untrained will think that the guy who&#39;s on his back is in a bad position and in some circumstances this can be true but for jiu jitsu&#39;s sake that is an offensive position you&#39;re in a great place to shoot submissions to effect sweeps so these are things that you&#39;re going to be focusing on when you have someone in your guard sweeps and submissions now I don&#39;t like to speak in absolutes because there are submissions that you can shoot from being inside someone&#39;s guard like the can opener but we&#39;re talking Basics here in Jiu Jitsu there are so many what-ifs and if you let that bog you down you&#39;re never going to get anywhere you need to learn the fundamentals first and then move on to the what ifs when they happen now transversely if you are in your opponent&#39;s guard that is a defensive position your objective here is to break open their guard pass their guard and get the side body so that you can start looking for submissions now again are there opportunities to hit submissions when you&#39;re stuck in someone&#39;s guard yes but it&#39;s very few compared to what your opponent has being stuck in his garden thus making this more of a defensive position than anything you want to get out you want to break his guard you want to pass his guard and you want to get the sidebar as a white belt you&#39;ll probably notice that you get stuck in guard quite frequently especially with higher belts this is a great opportunity to work on your defense which is the Journey of a white belt you sharpen your defense first as submissions come later trust me next position Mount now if you&#39;re the person on top so you are mounting your opponent this is an offensive of position this is a great opportunity to use your body weight technique and gravity to wear out your opponent we&#39;re looking to hold this position pin our opponent down even smother our opponent while also looking for submissions transversely if you&#39;re the person being mounted you&#39;re in a defensive position your main goal is to get out of there so whether you&#39;re either escaping completely or getting a half guard which we will cover your main objective is to get out of there it&#39;s probably in my opinion the second worst position to be in outside of having your opponent directly on your back you get mounted you escape or you at least try next position side body now if you&#39;re the guy on top your opponent is in your side body and this is a great place to be it&#39;s an offensive position so you&#39;re either looking to pin you&#39;re looking to move into submissions or even progressing the position into Mount or neon belly if you&#39;re coming from a wrestling background you&#39;re going to feel really comfortable here you&#39;re going to feel at home I know I did coming into this as a wrestler this was probably one of two positions questions that I felt comfortable with I felt I knew the objective of and for the rest of you guys who aren&#39;t coming from a wrestling background it&#39;s just like I said it&#39;s an offensive position you&#39;re looking to pin you&#39;re looking to submit you&#39;re looking to progress the position into something like Mount or neon belly now if we flip it and you&#39;re the guy who&#39;s stuck inside body this is a defensive position you&#39;re looking to regain your guard or potentially even sweep and there are a couple cool sweeps from this position that&#39;ll help put you back in a dominant position and maybe even put your opponent back in your side body as a brand new white belt you&#39;ve probably noticed at this position along with mounts are really hard to get out of when you&#39;re going against someone who knows what they&#39;re doing instinctually we want to freak out and spaz out and do all these big explosive movements that really just Tire us out in the end in order to get out of mounts or to get out of someone else&#39;s side body you need to be Technical and obviously strength has a huge part of this but strength with technique is a beautiful thing my biggest advice for you as you begin to learn these positions and their escapes try your very best not to be Spazzy I want you to be intense and I want you to be effective but I want you to use good technique as well and if you can use good technique with strength that&#39;s a really nice combination now if you&#39;re just using strength and you&#39;re being erratic and you&#39;re trying to explode out and you&#39;re not applying any technique that&#39;s a great way to gas out and be stuck in that position that you are already in but more tired so try not to freak out try to be smart you can be intense be explosive but use good technique as you learn that technique and I think that&#39;ll take you really far and I just want to take a second to give a quick shout out to my sponsor X Marshall X Marshall is a growing combat sport brand that&#39;s

Jitsu gear all right that&#39;s enough gun bumping let&#39;s get back to the video all right next position half guard so if you&#39;re in my half guard and I&#39;m laying on my back or my side and I&#39;ve got both my legs in the game and you haven&#39;t passed my guard yet I can still attack with my legs and you cannot you can only really attack with your arms until you pass my guard so with that being said half guard if you&#39;re in my half guard and I&#39;m on my back I&#39;m in an offensive position I&#39;m looking for sweeps I&#39;m looking for submissions I&#39;m looking to progress my situation now transversely if you are in my half guard your defense right you&#39;re looking to either pass my guard completely get the side body and then look for submissions or progressing the position itself or you&#39;re defending my submission attempts now you&#39;ll see that there is some similarity between this and the regular guard except it&#39;s just the position of our legs it&#39;s really different and because of that it allows me to shoot different submissions and different sweeps remember we&#39;re talking Jiu Jitsu here so in the world of Jiu Jitsu half guard is pretty unique but if we switch over to something like MMA even as the person who&#39;s in the offensive position I&#39;m not as big of a fan of it there because if you&#39;re going against someone who&#39;s a power puncher and they&#39;re raining down hard hits on your jaw which is something that happens we see this in the UFC all the time it doesn&#39;t seem like such a great position to put it plainly if you&#39;re a white belt and you don&#39;t have a good understanding of half guard and you get into a fight in a bar on the street I wouldn&#39;t jump into half guard if you do that I would expect to get punched in the face even as someone who has a good understanding of half guard it&#39;s still very likely so you have to be careful in the situation that you&#39;re using these positions obviously this is a jiu jitsu video but I would hate to hear about a white belt who watched this tried half guard didn&#39;t understand it and got their face knocked in strikes change everything and that&#39;s one of the things I really love about my school is that we will throw MMA gloves on and we will incorporate strikes into some of our rolling sessions I&#39;m telling you if you don&#39;t do that it&#39;s a whole different world and while it might not apply to maybe competition circuit and Jiu Jitsu it does apply to the street because not a lot of people know Jiu Jitsu but everybody knows how to throw at least a crappy punch right so something to think about moving forward with that position and that&#39;s the video guys I hope you found it helpful I know that at white belt I could have used something like this so even if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s Beyond being brand new and you have a good understanding feel free to send this to your buddy who&#39;s brand new or your buddy who&#39;s thinking about joining this kind of info would have been so helpful for me in the beginning and instead of learning the hard way I could have just watched this and understood what was going on a little bit better and remember guys if you&#39;re a white belt the Journey of a white belt is to lose it&#39;s tap it&#39;s to develop your defense so if this is happening to you and you&#39;re constantly tapping out in practice don&#39;t let this get you down this is part of the journey it helps develop you it helps develop your defense which is going to come in handy very much so later on down the road we&#39;ve all been there we&#39;ve all gone through it we&#39;ve all been frustrated with it and we&#39;ve all learned from it so try not to be too sour about it use it learn from it and move on and if you like the video if you found it helpful hit the like button for me that kind of stuff helps me more than you know it also tells me what you guys want to see helping me provide you with more Jiu-Jitsu content so with that being said this specific video inspired me to change my ending slogan that I normally hit you guys with what we&#39;re going to say from now on is sometimes backwards always forwards it is very much the Journey of Jiu Jitsu no matter what belt you are it&#39;s helped me on more than one occasion and hopefully it can help you so sometimes backwards always forwards I&#39;ll catch you guys in the next one [Music] thank you
