      "subtitles": "(groovy hip-hop music) - So it&#39;s a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones\non the day they come out. And we&#39;re upholding\nthis tradition this year to find one single difference\nversus last year&#39;s unboxings. So we&#39;ve got four iPhones\nhere in new colors: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, which the boxes show\nthe back of the phones. And then iPhone 16 Pro\nand iPhone 16 Pro Max, which show the front. And I&#39;m totally gonna\nstart with the base phones, the crowd favorites this year. Finally, some colors back\nin the iPhone lineup. So, I&#39;m gonna call this\none the flagship color. This is the Ultra Marine iPhone 16. And in the box, you get the USB-C cable, again, braided and high quality, and then a tiny little bit of\npaperwork in this pill shape. And then you&#39;ll notice no SIM\ncard tool, same as last year, and no stickers this year. There are no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box at all. Truly the end of an era. They just can&#39;t stop removing things, they can&#39;t help themselves. But let&#39;s get a look at the\npink plus-sized phone, too. These phones are the\nsame sizes as last year: 6.1 inches for the base,\n6.7 inches for the Plus. But with the bigger batteries inside, that&#39;s something I&#39;m\nreally happy to hear about and very curious about in my testing. But really, I&#39;m just happy\nwe finally have colors back. So the back of the phone,\nit&#39;s a little more pale, but the glass around the\ncamera is a bit darker, the rails of the phone are a\nbit darker, so this is nice. Same stuff in the box. Now, with these Pro phones, I think there&#39;s a reason they show the front of the phone on the box because, if they showed the back, you literally could\nnot tell the difference versus last year. But hey, at least this one has slightly thinner bezels they can show. And yeah, this year is gonna be the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro. And aside from the lack\nof stickers in the box, it&#39;s gonna look and feel\nbasically exactly like a titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Same USB-C cable as the\nbase phone, as well. Great. But then, this is the\nnew flagship Pro color. The renders we saw at\nfirst were kind of weird, but this is the official\nDesert Titanium color. And you know, all of Apple&#39;s phones are, again, a bit more pale on the back, but they have more color on these rails, and that&#39;s definitely true again here. It&#39;s kind of like a light sand color but also feels similar\nto the gold of the past. But there you have it. That&#39;s the iPhone 16&#39;s\nunboxing experience. So, by the time you see this uploaded, that means I am deep\ninto my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review. So, definitely, get subscribed\nto see that when it drops. But if there are any things that you specifically\nwanna see talked about more or that haven&#39;t been talked about enough for the review of the phones, let me know in the comment section below. But I can still give you now some quick things that I&#39;ve\nnoticed in my first couple days, my first week of testing, some FAQs. So, first up, there is a size\ndifference versus last year. The base phones are the\nsame sizes, like I said, 6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes. But the Pro phones are both bigger. The iPhone 16 Pro goes\nfrom 6.1 to 6.3 inches, and even though it has thinner bezels, yes, the phone is slightly\ntaller and slightly wider. And then, the iPhone 16 Pro Max goes from 6.7 inches to\n6.9 inches diagonally, which is now just an\nabsolutely gigantic phone. I mean, it was already huge, but it&#39;s now even taller and wider. Biggest phone they&#39;ve ever made. If you look at it next\nto the Galaxy S24 Ultra, that&#39;s another absolutely\nhuge phone for some context, and that phone has a stylus in it. So obviously, Apple&#39;s put\nmore battery in this phone, which is great to see. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not going\nthe opposite direction of, like, making it thinner\nor shrinking the batteries. But yeah, just it&#39;s\ndefinitely good to know if you&#39;re going with the\nnew Pro Max this year, you are getting a truly huge, like, borderline tablet-sized phone. Also, random tidbit: Thanks to these new\ncameras up in the corners, these new iPhones are\nbig-time table rockers. Like, big-time uneven camera on the back. It&#39;s annoying to me &#39;cause I\ntype on the table sometimes. Anyway, I&#39;ve also been\ntaking some pictures and videos with the new cameras. I&#39;ll be taking and\nposting many, many more. If you wanna follow me on Instagram, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll see some more in the next couple of days,\nbut I&#39;ll link that below. My first impression is\nit&#39;s kind of remarkable how consistent Apple&#39;s\nimage processing pipeline is to get the same look every year. Like a lot of times, we see\ncompanies switch sensors. Even the Pixels switched sensors after using the same old one for a while, and the whole look kind of changed. But it really feels like year over year, no matter how many hardware changes, no matter how many sensor\nchanges these phones go through, they still just very much\nhave the iPhone look, which, I mean, makes sense. This just shallower depth of field from the larger physical sensor. I have also run some benchmarks. So these are the new Geekbench 6 scores for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones, which are new versus last year. Really not noticing, like, a huge difference in performance\nwith these brand-new phones. Obviously, you&#39;re gonna feel\nthat more at the very high end and in the long term as these phones age. But what Geekbench also did reveal is all of these phones across the board have eight gigs of RAM now. So, there&#39;s typically been\ndifferent amounts of RAM in the Pro phone versus the regular phone. Now, there&#39;s not. Now, they all have eight gigs of RAM. So Apple was giving us a\nlot of talk in that keynote about how these are the first phones built from the ground up\nfor Apple Intelligence. Is that what this means? I mean, you clearly need a lot of memory to run these AI models, and there&#39;s also a more\npowerful neural engine on all the phones versus last year. So maybe that&#39;s a part of it, too. But all that talk and these\nphones all launch with iOS 18.0, which has exactly zero Apple\nIntelligence features on them at launch out the box. But that&#39;s a rant for another day. But clearly, the biggest\nphysical new change on these new phones is\nthis added button here. And Apple refused to call\nit a button in the keynote and then doubled down. They also did a bunch of,\nlike, executive interviews on various YouTube channels that you can go watch from that day, and even in those interviews, they continue to refuse\nto call it a button. It&#39;s so weird. - To just put out the\nbiggest burning fire, right up front, in the discourse. It is a real button, right? - Ah!\n(group laughing) - It&#39;s a physical thing\nthat depresses, right? - I think it&#39;s a first of its kind. There is a tactile switch, that\ngives you that final click. - So, just to clear it up, it is an actual moving\nclicking physical button that is called Camera Control. (laughs) But it&#39;s more than a button. It&#39;s also made it to all these\nphones, not just the Pros. So, let me jump into that. This Camera Control button,\nas the name implies, only controls camera-related things. So it&#39;s not like another Action button, it&#39;s a Camera Control button. You can hit it once it\nopens up the camera, you can hit it again to take a photo, and then you can hold it down to start recording a quick video. But it&#39;s also a large capacitive touch-sensitive surface with\na vibration motor underneath. So it doesn&#39;t actually half-press, but with that vibration motor, it can mimic the feeling of a half-press, like a real camera would have. And you can double-tap to flip through various\ncamera controls like zoom or photographic styles, or tone. It takes some getting used to. I mean, these swipes, they also you can see\nhave momentum physics too, so you can swipe too fast or too far and go past what you were aiming for or zoom past where you thought you would. So it can feel a bit finicky and silly as you start using it, especially since you can\nliterally do all this stuff with the buttons already on the screen. But when you use Camera Control, all of the rest of those\nbuttons just fade away and disappear, kind of\nencouraging you to continue using the Camera Control to find\nwhat you&#39;re trying to do. It&#39;s really interesting. The placement feels like it was\nmade with landscape in mind, but landscape ideally\nwould&#39;ve been at the corner. But they also know a lot\nof people take photos and videos like this, so it can&#39;t be all the way at the bottom. So they moved it up. So, it&#39;s kind of splitting\nthe difference here. And also, third-party apps\nwill be able to plug into it if they use the camera. So this is already working with Kino, and it&#39;s supposed to start working with Snapchat pretty soon as well. And you can imagine other\napps that use the camera will just decide what\nthey wanna do with it. I was also curious, though, and I said this in that\noriginal impressions video, how cases would deal with\nthis new button surface thing. So it turns out there&#39;s\nbasically two options. Option number one is just a\ncutout in the side of the case. Just cut it out, expose it to the finger. So it&#39;s fine. That&#39;s probably what\nmost cheap cases will do, but that also means it&#39;s\nno longer gonna be flush with the side of the case. But then there&#39;s option number two, which is what Apple&#39;s\nfirst-party cases do, which is putting in this\nlittle insert, which has glass and transfers the capacitance from the button outside of the case to the Camera Control of the phone itself and maintaining that flush feel. And it feels like it works pretty well. The half press still works fine, the swiping still works fine, the vibration motor transfers through. And the Beats by Dre cases\nalso already have this. Yeah, I&#39;m just gonna say\nthat again real quick in case you were just\nphasing out for a second. There&#39;s Beats by Dre iPhone\ncases now. (chuckles) Like, since when does Beats make cases? Like, why does Beats make cases? I thought, I don&#39;t know,\nthere was a theme of, like, Beats being audio products, but there&#39;s something new going on here. Maybe now they&#39;re just iPhone accessories? I don&#39;t know. But yeah, they&#39;ve got a nice little Camera Control button thing\non their new iPhone cases, which is nice. I kind of wish, and I&#39;m not alone, that this was also Touch ID, but then they couldn&#39;t call\nit Camera Control, I guess. I wonder if that&#39;s in the\nfuture of this button. But anyway, speaking of\nthird-party accessories, that&#39;s where dbrand stepped\nin to sponsor this video. So, for this sponsor segment,\nwe&#39;re gonna be doing something a little bit different. See, screen protectors,\nnot my favorite thing. They&#39;re kind of a chore to install, between the dust and the\nalignment and getting it perfect. That&#39;s a big part of why I\ndon&#39;t use them all the time. But that&#39;s where channel\nsponsor dbrand comes in. They seem to believe that I can install their Prism 2.0 screen\nprotector blindfolded. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna try to do. Instructions that I&#39;ve been\ntold are pretty simple. To just get the screen protector, get the phone, and then line it up. Which is like that. (fingers tapping) And then pull the tab like that. (plastic tab rustling) And then just swipe down\nthe middle to press it down. Give it a couple seconds. And then that should be it. Let&#39;s see. Take this off. (installation frame clunking) And that doesn&#39;t even\nlook like it&#39;s installed. But it is. It totally is. And it&#39;s perfect. Nice. Okay. Yeah, every Prism comes with two of these, so if you get the first one\nwrong, you can get a second try. But if you wanna check\nthese out for the iPhone or any number of phones\nthat they make for it, I&#39;ll have a link below. All right. That&#39;s been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (groovy hip-hop music)"

      "subtitles": "all right I&#39;m back I&#39;m back from Australia all the way from Down Under And I did bring exactly one souvenir with me but I flew in this morning cuz Apple said they were going to announce some stuff and they did there was an event today so here&#39;s my first impressions so we got the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro today along with new airpods and Apple watch and I&#39;ve got some handson and some first impressions for you of all that stuff right here so so let&#39;s just start with the new phones we knew this was coming right a very very minor incremental overall update but somehow Apple&#39;s still got to try to get people to buy it so what will they do so iPhone 16 looks very much like iPhone 15 but there&#39;s some new colors as you can pretty much always count on this year it&#39;s ultramarine which is kind of this Indigo pretty sick teal pink black and white and the cameras instead of being diagonally oriented are now lined up again next to each other like it was back in the iPhone 10 days but it&#39;s not just a retro touch that&#39;s also so it can shoot spatial videos and pictures now so the sensors are aligned with each other again but then everything else the rounded Corners the size of the regular phone and the plus phone the speakers the antenna lines everything just basically the same not much new going on here inside they bumped it up from the a16 bionic to a new a18 so there&#39;s some solid performance improvements in the 20 to 30% range better Ray tracing and a two times faster neural engine and 8 gigs of RAM for all that Apple intelligence stuff really the most underrated new hardware to me though that they talked about is Apple briefly mentioned that these new phones will all have larger batteries and so that seems to imply that it will actually have better battery life but also at no point did Apple ever say any numbers not a single number was uttered during the battery section no graphs or anything like that so we don&#39;t know exactly how much bigger this new battery actually is and the only numbers we&#39;ve been able to find is if you look on Apple&#39;s compare page for the phones it said the iPhone 15 would get a battery life of 20 hours of video playback and this new 16 gets 22 so I&#39;m going to be putting these through the paces you already know if you want to get subscribed to be among the first to see the full review that&#39;s when we&#39;ll be able to figure out if it&#39;s actually a significant Improvement in battery in other ways but as of right now better battery sure and then I never thought I&#39;d say this sentence again but this new iPhone has two new buttons so first of all it gets the action button from last year&#39;s Pro so now you can do the exact same customized shortcuts from a flashlight or Shazam to a series shortcut or whatever you want and then there&#39;s also another new button called camera control and this second button it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s a touch sensitive cutout covered in Sapphire with a taptic engine behind it now it does actually move it is an actual button just to be clear but just like the trackpad on a lot of modern laptops the vibration motor clicks to also make a half press feel like you&#39;re clicking a two-stage button like a camera shutter button and it is also very convincing so the magic of this camera control area is what they&#39;re calling it is that it is pressure sensitive and it&#39;s basically a tiny trackpad on the corner of the phone it&#39;s it&#39;s capacitive sensitive so you can swipe and do gestures along the corner of the phone and so Apple&#39;s decided everything that this button will do will be camera related so if you press it from the lock screen it opens the camera app and then when you&#39;re in you can click it again to take a photo or long press to start taking a short video but then you can do a little half strength double tap to open up a menu for different camera options and then slide your finger along this camera control to change them so you know it takes some getting used to you got to get used to the placement of your hand and how fast you swipe but once you kind of know what you&#39;re doing it feels pretty smooth and it&#39;s pretty sensitive and intuitive so this is all a bunch of functionality that&#39;s being added basically into Apple&#39;s camera app but Apple&#39;s also said that thirdparty apps that use the camera will also be able to take advantage of the camera control so Snapchat Instagram highight Etc they&#39;ll be able to also use the slider so I think it&#39;s pretty cool I think it&#39;s technically very impressive I&#39;m just trying to figure out kind of similar to the action button how useful it will actually be like it is kind of in this awkward spot on the bottom right of the phone it makes sense as a horizontal shutter button but they&#39;re kind of splitting the difference trying to also make it usable in a vertical Ori orientation I just I&#39;m curious how many people actually use this regularly cuz again it is on all the phones but yeah that&#39;s about it for the 16 I mean the display also does now drop down to one nit minimum brightness so that&#39;s that&#39;s great at night it is also still a 60 HZ display on an $800 Flagship in 2024 so that&#39;s really disappointing for me personally but overall this phone is I&#39;d say it&#39;s still pretty tempting to say that this base model is probably a better buy for most most people over the pro phones but let&#39;s just get into the pro phones shall we new colors this year desert titanium which goes alongside the classic natural titanium and then a slightly darker black and a slightly whiter white but otherwise same design again plus the new camera control and the main updates with the pro are the new screens and the new chip so the phones actually get slightly bigger this year so the screen sizes are up to 6.3 in on the pro and 6.9 in on the pro Max thanks to the thinner bezels which I didn&#39;t think I would notice but I&#39;m actually looking at them and they are a little noticeably thinner so you can kind of tell and inside there is also a new chip as well it&#39;s the a18 pro so this is the new highest end chip in any iPhone and this again should have performance boost and efficiency boost over last year&#39;s Pro phone again in the 20 to 30% range so CPU and GPU improving better rate tracing should still have the faster USB 3 speeds that the pros get uh but again the efficiency improvements have them saying that the pro Max will now be the longest battery life ever in an iPhone by how much I don&#39;t really know but that&#39;s that&#39;s good to see but the camera is of course always the highlight of the pro phones and there are three new cameras on these Pros versus last year so a new 48 megapixel main camera then a higher resolution 48 megapixel ultrawide camera from the 12 from last year and then the smaller Pro also gets a 5x telephoto now so the smaller Pro used to have a 3X but now both Pros have matching all three cameras it&#39;s also wireless charging a little bit faster 25 watts so that&#39;ll get you 50% in 30 minutes of charging with the new mag safe charger nothing too crazy and also 4K 120 FPS slow motion straight out of the cameras now and that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty sick I&#39;m sure the file sizes will be nuts from the prores version of this but it gives you really functional files that you can do a lot with it also totally proves to me that they could handle processing enough to shoot 8K 3030 but they&#39;re just choosing not to now there was a whole lot of talk a whole long section of the keynote where they constantly talked about Apple intelligence and I mean they have to because it&#39;s a really big deal for them but the thing is these phones will launch with iOS 18 18.0 and that means they will launch with no apple intelligence features at all no gen mooji no image playground no writing tools nothing that shiny brand new iPhone 16 that you take out the box in September 2024 and start using in a couple weeks will have the old Siri on it now they&#39;ll start to come out bit by bit with software updates so 18.1 has the new Siri and a bunch of writing tools and some other stuff but it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming harder and harder to pair that stuff directly to this new phone as a part of this upgrade I mean if you&#39;ve watched my videos before you know about one of the golden rules which is to never buy something based on the promise of future software updates so this feels like a big separation moment for the iPhone at least to me where each year of the new physical phone that you buy is just a small Improvement it&#39;s just a little bit faster chip a little bit better screen slightly better cameras but on the other side is this rapidly improving ball of all this AI stuff that is not launching on the phone but that is the totally separate really big reason to get the phone so yeah it feels like I&#39;m going to need to review all of that stuff separately in its entirety when it does finally come out because it it comes out so separately from the phone itself um anyway there were also some other Apple announcements today aside from just the iPhones and we got new airpods and new watches so there were lots of rumors about this huge redesign with the Apple watch for the 10th year but now that we actually see it Apple Watch series 10 is mostly slightly new again now okay it is 10% thinner and 10% lighter and that&#39;s nice and it has a slightly larger display again with thinner bezels and better viewing angles plus a new S10 sip inside that&#39;s it oh and of course you got to throw some new colors as well so the aluminum has silver or rose gold or this new jet black finish which is a bit of a shiny throwback and then they&#39;ve dropped stainless steel for titanium which now comes in natural tit tanium gold colored or slate colored so that&#39;s the redesign again it is pretty minor uh I don&#39;t want to downplay the amount of technical engineering that goes into achieving these things like clearly you still have to combine the metal back plate and the charger into one piece with the antennas integrated to improve the thinness and they&#39;re using what they&#39;re calling the first wide angle OLED display to help you see the screen from more angles which actually does matter on a watch but yeah I think if you were expecting some crazy radical you know Square watch or something nuts then yeah this is very much still the classic Apple watch shape there are some new watch faces since the second hand now is always visible even when always on display is gone dark so that&#39;s cool there&#39;s also a new depth app and a new tie Z which I think looks really cool I don&#39;t even surf or have any use for this app but it&#39;s just kind of cool flipping through and seeing exactly when sunrise and Sundown are and high tide and low tide are every day if you&#39;re near a coastline they also introduced sleep apnea detection using only the gyroscope this is another coming soon feature it&#39;s like pending FDA approval and Regulatory bodies around the world to actually launch but the fact that it only needs a gyroscope to detect it I thought that was pretty cool so those series 10 watches are going to start at the same prices as last year&#39;s series 10 watches and then we also got a new Apple watch Ultra 2 and by new Apple watch Ultra 2 I mean a satin black finish of the existing Apple watch Ultra 2 and I am so into it I have absolutely no real reason to upgrade but this is just one of those things that companies sometimes do they just make a matte black version of something that I totally don&#39;t need but suddenly they have my shipping address and credit card info and I just end up buying one I&#39;m told this is a pretty robust coding process so hopefully it shouldn&#39;t chip or scratch too easily and then maybe show like light raw titanium underneath but also it&#39;s an ultra watch so I think someone&#39;s going to do it but then there are also the new airpods the airpods upgrades or upgrades one of them one of them&#39;s a fake upgrade so the new base airpods airpods 4 have been redesigned and there&#39;s actually two versions so for 129 there&#39;s the new airpods 4 with the new shape and then for 179 there&#39;s the same new airpods version but you also get active noise cancellation and a wireless charging case with a tiny speaker built in for find my so yeah this new shape it&#39;s a little different so it may fit a little better in some people&#39;s ears like mine like the old ones or terrible for me but these are a little better but that also means they may be a little bit worse in some people&#39;s ears but yeah to get I think for under 200 bucks active noise cancellation in airpods with a 4-Hour battery life I think there&#39;ll be a nice little Target demographic waiting for that and then airpods Pro 2 didn&#39;t really get a whole lot technically new here but they also did get certified as a clinical grade hearing aid which is pretty awesome plus some other hearing protection and testing features are added as well but the biggest upgrade of the day and by that I mean non upgrade fake upgrade of the day goes to airpods Max now keep in mind these headphones came out originally in 2020 like we reviewed these a long time ago these were $550 when they launched and they&#39;re still $550 in 2024 and they still have a lightning port and they still don&#39;t have an onoff button and they still have that dumb case that they came with so they finally get this update airpods Pro 2 and the update is five new colors and they have a USBC Port now which okay yeah they literally had a lightning port in 2024 so we&#39;re happy to see that but then that&#39;s it like there&#39;s not a single other change to these new airpods they still don&#39;t have an onoff button in 2024 they still have that stupid case they came with like they got the feedback we know this case isn&#39;t good they didn&#39;t improve that at all they still have the H1 chip even though all the other airpods are on on the H2 chip now what did the entire airpods Max team go into a coma for 4 years and then wake up a week before this announcement and scramble to put this together this is weird the sad part is I&#39;m probably still going to upgrade to them anyway because I just I can&#39;t carry a lightning cable around anymore and I keep forgetting it and then they keep dying and I keep needing a lightning cable and it&#39;s just let me just stop having that headache but yeah weird non- upgrade very disappointing airpods Max but that&#39;s basically it those are my announcement thoughts and reactions and first impressions and generally yeah not a ton of major new stuff I think really the two big highlights are one this separation between the hardware upgrade and all the software that&#39;s coming to the hardware but not launching with it and honestly two is is this camera control thing this weird button that they&#39;ve added it&#39;s fascinating the fact that they&#39;ve added it to both the pro and non-pro phones when I didn&#39;t think they would that&#39;s interesting the fact that case manufacturers are going to have to deal with this now like some of them are going to have a little cutout for it but some of them may try to do the same thing Apple did with like a little capacitive glass thing over the top of it to keep it flush that&#39;s interesting the fact that it won&#39;t come out with the two-stage shutter press in the actual camera app until later this year via a software update that&#39;s just weird too there&#39;s just a lot of fun weird stuff going on with the shutter button but now that you&#39;ve made it this far let me know in the comment section down below what you want to see in those full reviews as you get subscribed to see them and thanks to Anor for sponsoring this video their latest mag go lineup is out the six series and there&#39;s a couple changes there&#39;s a new Slimmer battery bank there&#39;s a battery bank with an Apple Watch charger a stand with a rotating click head and one of my favorite items a 3in1 foldable charging pad so the ankor Mago power bank is a 10,000 mAh battery that supports ch2 and it&#39;s mag safe compatible it supports 15 W wireless charging and temperature control so it keeps your device is protected by keeping charging under 40\u00b0 C all in this slim 15 mm body and then the anchor Mago wireless charging station this thing charges three devices at once an iPhone airpods and your Apple watch all at the same time it supports ch25 wat fast charging and mag safe charging for iPhones and it just folds up into this compact little package fits in your pocket and it can even fold the other way to make it into a stand to activate Apple standby mode while you charge your phone so yeah check these out at the link below and start charging your devices faster but yeah that&#39;s been it thanks for watching this impress video and I&#39;ll catch you guys in the next one soon peace [Music]"

      "subtitles": "(Windows chiming) - Okay, I&#39;ve been waiting\nfor this for a while. As someone who&#39;s been on the sidelines of the Windows game for a little while now and seeing all this hype and this new matte black laptop that&#39;s supposed to be generational, it&#39;s got me thinking, is it legit? Like have Windows laptops\nactually caught up to the Apple Silicon leap\nfrom a couple years ago? Because this is a new\nMicrosoft Surface laptop and it doesn&#39;t have an Intel chip inside, it doesn&#39;t have an AMD chip inside, this laptop has a Qualcomm\nSnapdragon X Elite chip inside, meaning it is an ARM laptop. Now, years ago, Apple went\nthrough this transition from Intel chips to ARM chips and it was crazy successful, like, no one could really\nmatch their efficiency and seamless integration, the vertical integration, the overall package of their laptops just took a quantum leap forward. Now Windows laptops around\nthe same time, actually, if you remember kind of\ntried the same thing, I don&#39;t know if you\nremember the Surface Pro X, that didn&#39;t go so well and so we&#39;ve continued to have Intel and AMD laptops since then. But it seems like this\none has gone way better. So I&#39;ve been using this laptop\nfor the past couple weeks, you might have seen me with\nit on the Waveform Podcast, and I&#39;ve got a pretty good\nidea now of what&#39;s gone well and what is still a trade off. So the big advantage, the mega quantum leap\nforward was inefficiency, which in a laptop with\nthe same size battery means a dramatically\nimproved battery life, and this laptop absolutely\ngot a big bump up. So I remember reading reviews\nof the last Surface laptop with an Intel chip, which already had a\npretty solid battery life, and the Microsoft quote was 19 hours. This one&#39;s quote is 23 hours, but what that&#39;s translated to for me, basically, is all day battery life for mixed use with no worries, like, that&#39;s high brightness,\nweb browsing, email, watching videos, research type activities, and then, ending the\nday at like 40% easily. So I just really don&#39;t\nthink about charging much, which is awesome for a 14-inch laptop. On paper, it&#39;s getting compared a lot to the M3 13-inch MacBook Air and it even outlasts it on\nsome synthetic benchmarks, which is awesome. So that&#39;s one success,\ndefinitely check the box, great battery life, love that. And then, the other second success that we were looking forward to was just a well optimized performance. And it&#39;s not like the super\nhigh end gaming performance, I&#39;m not talking about\nthat type of performance, but I just mean like a general\nsmoothness and consistency and rock solid performance across all your everyday regular tasks, that sort of performance. Now I&#39;m gonna get into\napp support in a minute, but I basically found this\nto be a very capable laptop. Now again, I&#39;ve been on the sidelines from Windows for a bit, so I don&#39;t have as many reference points, but this is a $2,000 14-inch laptop that can basically do anything I ask of it without breaking a sweat. Photo editing in Affinity, not a problem. Literally anything in the\nMicrosoft Office Suite, no problem, whether\nyou&#39;re plugged in or not. You know, I found the track\npad gestures are pretty smooth, the graphics of the whole UI in general are consistent from full\nbattery to nearly dead. So using a software\nthat runs natively on it is snappy and a great experience. But that very quickly gets\nyou into the conversation about the downside of switching to ARM. This is what I was curious\nabout repeating from last time, and this actually happened\nin the Mac world too when they made this transition, the number one difficulty to changing the entire\narchitecture of your computer is actually app compatibility. So I remember, when the\nMac went through this, there were basically three types of apps. There&#39;s obviously optimized\napps at the top of the list, like that&#39;s the ideal, obviously, all the first party apps are optimized off the bat and Apple did a lot of work trying to get as many\ndevelopers onboard as possible to get their apps optimized on ARM. But then there were apps\nthat were built for x86 but would still work on\nARM through emulation. So they&#39;d not perform necessarily\nas well as they could, but at least they worked anyway. And then, there were apps\nthat just didn&#39;t work at all. So right now for Windows on ARM, you have these three types of apps again, and my assessment is that, at this very moment, there&#39;s pretty good\nsupport for native apps as far as things people use every day. But it&#39;s definitely still not perfect. So, okay, Photoshop and\nLightroom CC run native, Chrome, Spotify, Prime\nVideo, Dropbox, Zoom, like there&#39;s a lot of\npopular apps across the board that just run natively and they&#39;re super smooth\nand they&#39;re great, they don&#39;t hit battery\nhard at all, love that. So then there are some apps that I used that don&#39;t support Windows on ARM but do get emulated, so\nthey still work technically. So Lightroom Classic is a big one, my to-do list app of Choice is TickTick, you might have heard of it, I&#39;ve referenced it a few times\nand it&#39;s a great example. If you go to their website, they only have x86 versions of the app and I downloaded and ran the\n64 bit version and it works, but it doesn&#39;t actually run very well. I actually notice some\nreal chop and some lag with certain parts of the UI, and it&#39;s not even that heavy of an app, it&#39;s just a to-do list app. And there&#39;s a long list of apps\nin this sort of limbo phase where you don&#39;t necessarily know if there&#39;s going to be an ARM native app around the corner or not &#39;cause adoption&#39;s not super high, it&#39;s not really a huge incentive\nfor them to make one yet, but you can still use it, it&#39;s just not gonna be\nthe ideal experience. It might churn through\nbattery a little bit quickly, but it still works. But then there are just apps that straight up don&#39;t work at all yet. Arc browser, Google Drive on desktop, I rely heavily on that, that does not have any\ncompatibility at all with Windows on ARM, VMware doesn&#39;t work, a\nlot of VPNs don&#39;t work, and a lot of games straight up don&#39;t run, like some of &#39;em are uncompatible, but also a lot of them which\nmight have ordinarily run have anti-cheat software that\ndoesn&#39;t run on Windows on ARM so the game just doesn&#39;t work at all. And there&#39;s even some apps that actually now that I\nthink about it are compatible, but their websites for the\ncompanies that make them don&#39;t actually highlight\nor prominently show the download for the ARM version, so it&#39;s kind of confusing\nand it&#39;s hard to find. So it&#39;s just kind of all\nover the place right now. So my take here is, look, if you are at all\nconsidering a Windows ARM laptop, specifically, look up the\napps that you have to use and make sure they&#39;re at least compatible, at least emulatable &#39;cause there might be some promises of ARM versions coming soon, or just statements from a developer, I&#39;ve seen lots of those. But just check the programs that you know you&#39;re gonna need to work\nbecause, depending on who you are, you could be totally covered\nand fine or totally outta luck. So there are a couple Windows\nARM laptops out there, this is the one I obviously\nchose to mess with, the premium matte black one\nwith the Snapdragon X Elite. So here&#39;s a couple more of my observations scattered from my couple\nof weeks of using it. I gotta say the build\nquality is pretty awesome, as they have been with Surface\nfor a little while now. I love the all metal design, the keyboard&#39;s rock solid, big track pad with excellent haptics, and just really good\nfundamentals all around. The port selection is all right, it&#39;s still got that full size USB-A and then there&#39;s two USB-C\nwith the headphone jack. My only real downside I would say with it getting as pricey as it can get is that there is no OLED option. So instead it&#39;s a 2304x1536, 120 hertz LCD touchscreen with that 3x2 aspect ratio, and I love that it&#39;s tall, it&#39;s just, it can&#39;t quite\nmatch the deep blacks and contrast of an OLED, obviously, even though it&#39;s a pretty good LCD. So I just feel like I\nbasically traded the OLED for a high refresh rate here, but I would&#39;ve liked to\nhave seen an OLED option. And then just know that it&#39;s not, like, it&#39;s not like a\nsuper high-end gaming PC. It&#39;s very strong in\nperformance across the board, it&#39;ll do all the other things. But similar to Apple&#39;s M Series laptops, like it&#39;s a built-in GPU, it&#39;s not gonna be as\npowerful as a dedicated GPU. So don&#39;t expect, I mean, you\ncan still play some games, sure, but you&#39;re not getting this laptop to max out frame rates in\n&quot;Elden Ring&quot; or something. If you study the benchmarks enough, you&#39;ll find that these\nchips have a lot of cores, but weaker individual performance on like a single core basis. So it&#39;s good at throwing\na lot of cores at tasks and getting things done and\nthat&#39;s nice, just note that. And it&#39;s generally pretty\ngood at staying cool and not spinning up the fans,\nwhich I also think is great. And then, of course, this is also one of the\nvery first copilot PCs, so it&#39;s got the dedicated\ncopilot button on the keyboard. And so, yeah, this chip has an NPU, which does specific AI related processing. Things like the studio camera effects that are built into the camera or the forced artificial\neye contact in the camera, and it&#39;ll do it without pulling anything from the CPU or GPU. And, of course, you can\nalways hit that copilot button to talk to Microsoft Copilot, ask it anything, the same way you&#39;d talk to\nBing or ChatGPT or Gemini. But overall, this laptop\nis a good start, I think. I mean, I&#39;ve been waiting personally for a premium built matte\nblack Windows laptop for a while on ARM and this is that, it&#39;s actually what we&#39;ve been waiting for. I think the question really is, does the software you use work on ARM? Like, that&#39;s the main question\nyou should be considering when thinking about if you&#39;re\ngonna buy one of these things. Now, before you go, here&#39;s a question. Have you ever looked at\na laptop or a smartphone and wondered, what&#39;s going on inside it? Because channel sponsor\ndbrand has your answers. Now you&#39;ve seen, for years now, one of my favorite party tricks has been this sheet of magnet paper. You just lay it down on any device to see where a few of the internals are, like the MagSafe magnet\narray or the speaker. dbrand&#39;s x-ray line takes\nthat magnet paper experience to a whole nother level, letting you see basically\nevery single component inside your device, and yes, this is an actual\nlegit X-ray of that device. Yes, dbrand took hundreds of\ndevices to a metrology lab and literally shot each one of them with a special X-ray machine\nfor maximum accuracy. And they also made a light\nmode version of every x-ray. So personally, I am into\nthe dark mode version, but hey, if you don&#39;t\nwanna have to choose, if you buy any X-ray skin, you&#39;ll get the other colorway\nfor free with your order. So if that sounds like a good deal to you, I&#39;ll leave a link for you\nto check &#39;em out below, it&#39;s dbrand.com/ x-ray. But yeah, that&#39;s been it, let me know what you think\nof the Surface laptop, of the whole Windows on ARM thing. I&#39;ll check out the comments,\nbut either way, let me know. Catch you guys on the next one, peace. (upbeat music)"

      "subtitles": "(upbeat music) - So I&#39;ve made a few references\nover the past couple years to that time that the\nFBI visited the studio, and I was asked not to talk about that for what I feel like are\npretty obvious reasons. So for years I haven&#39;t, but it turns out I am now\nfinally able to tell that story. So here we are. So for those of you who don&#39;t\nknow, we have a studio here, and it&#39;s in a larger building with more tenants in it obviously. It&#39;s like an office building. It&#39;s not exactly like an office building, but you know, there&#39;s a front desk, and security and all that. And I&#39;ve been in this building long enough that we have a pretty good\nrelationship with them. So we have this one rule, basically. So there&#39;s the guy at\nsecurity at the front desk. We&#39;ll call him Bob, just for this. But Bob and I have this one rule, which is that if anyone ever\nshows up at the front desk and asks for me that\nhe doesn&#39;t let them in. I have to come out and meet them to confirm that I was expecting them, and then I bring them back to our studio. So if someone just randomly shows up, which you shouldn&#39;t, but if they do, and I don&#39;t show up at\nthe front to meet them, then I wasn&#39;t supposed to meet them. But if I have someone\ncoming and I expect them, I meet &#39;em outside. That&#39;s our one rule, and we stick to it. So in June, 2020, it was pretty early in this\nnew space that we have, and it&#39;s also right\naround like peak COVID. So I had sent everybody home, and it was just me and\nAndrew coming into the studio to work on basically building furniture, and making videos, and recording\nthe podcast every week. So I got here pretty early on\none of those summer mornings, and I&#39;m starting to get\nall my stuff settled, and then there&#39;s a knock on the door. (door knocks) So I open the door, and it&#39;s\nour front desk guy, Bob. And Bob basically says, &quot;Hey\nMarques, there&#39;s some people with badges at the front desk to see you. I, of course didn&#39;t let them in, but if you would like\nto, they&#39;re up there.&quot; And then he just walked away. And my first thought is confusion. I&#39;m like, what? What did I do on the way here that someone with badges\nwould show up asking for me? I&#39;m a little concerned. I&#39;m not sure what to think. So there was a solid\nminute where I just like stood there in the doorway,\nlike, okay, do I go up there, or do I just stay here in the studio without asking who the\npeople with badges are? Eh. And then I just went up to the front. I went up, I went up to the front desk, and sure enough, there&#39;s three\npeople with badges there, and they walk right up to me, and they all like flash their badges. FBI, just like the movies. Like FBI agent this, IRS agent this. And they&#39;re like,\n&quot;Marques, good to see you. We&#39;ve got some questions for\nyou about the Escobar phone.&quot; So immediately I&#39;m relieved, but I&#39;m like, oh, oh,\noh, the Escobar phone. Oh. Because see, a few months earlier I had published a video\nabout the Escobar Fold. If you guys haven&#39;t seen that video, basically the story goes,\nthere&#39;s this company parading around and selling\nthis $400 gold folding phone, which they&#39;re gonna use to\ndestroy Apple and Samsung. And they had these insane\nmarketing campaigns and all this. But really what they were doing,\nas I uncovered in my video, was covering Samsung Galaxy folds cheaply with like gold stickers, and then shipping them to YouTubers and people who they believed\nwould talk about it positively. And then not shipping\nany of the other orders from regular people or the audiences that watched those videos. Those people were getting\nscammed out of their money. And honestly, in hindsight,\nI don&#39;t know how they thought they were gonna get away with this. Like it felt pretty obvious to me. But, you know, eventually\ntheir whole plan backfired when I made a video\nabout the entire thing. So now fast forward a couple months, and it actually makes sense that the FBI and the IRS are interested. I just didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t realize they were just gonna show\nup one day, but here we are. But, you know, shout out\nto Bob at the front desk for sticking to our rule. Even though he probably\nhad a bunch of people like Flash FBI badges at\nhim, he stuck to our rule, and that was great. So I appreciate that. But yeah, so I came out, I\nbrought them back to our spot, and they basically then\nhad a bunch of questions about that video and the process of dealing\nwith that company in any way. Like any and all communications\nthat I had with them, any email I&#39;d ever sent or\nreceived from them ever, they wanted everything. And actually it was\nfunny, another tidbit is, Andrew at the time had\njust started running the business email account here. And when they were asking like, has anybody else on your\nteam possibly ever been in email communication with this company? And I was like, I think Andrew might&#39;ve. And Andrew just had arrived at the studio and walked up to the\nfront door of our spot. And so I like, I go, &quot;Hey, hey, come in.&quot; And you know, first thing he sees is like me in an empty studio with\na bunch of people in suits, like waving him over. So he has a pretty funny\nalternate perspective on this story. So the FBI actually took\nthe half peeled Escobar Fold and the scratched gold\niPhone from my videos as evidence in the case. They literally asked for\nthem and took them away. They put &#39;em in sealed plastic bags that said evidence on them, which is why I said at the\nend of the smartphone awards that year- Also honorable mention\nto the Escobar Fold 2, which I also don&#39;t have on this desk because it is in the\npossession of the FBI. Someday I&#39;ll be able to tell that story. So as they&#39;re leaving, you know, they&#39;ve asked me all the questions. As the FBI and IRS people are leaving, they&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t talk about this at all publicly, please.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Of course, yeah. No, obviously you&#39;re the FBI, of course I&#39;m not gonna talk about it. I don&#39;t want to interfere with\nthe investigation in any way. But also like, when could I talk about it? Like, how long do you think\nbefore I am allowed to?&quot; And they said, &quot;We&#39;ll let you know.&quot; So I&#39;ve been biting my tongue for years, not talking about it,\nhinting at it a little bit, but not anything too serious. But since then, a lot of the\ndominoes have started to fall. You know, at first when\nthe scam was happening, PayPal stopped working with them. So they&#39;d switched to\nthis only non-refundable direct transfer thing with Klarna. And then they stopped\nworking with them too. And then eventually the whole\noperation starts falling down, and the guy at the head of\nit named Olaf Gustafsson, this guy finally ends up getting arrested and going to prison in Spain for fraud, and money laundering, and\na bunch of other things, basically for everything\nthat I talked about in those videos. So I&#39;ve been holding onto\nthis not really knowing like, okay, is it cool now that he&#39;s\nbehind bars to talk about it? So we actually reached back\nout to those same FBI agents because they left their cards, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh yeah, no, it&#39;s cool\nnow to talk about it. You&#39;re totally fine.&quot; So there unfortunately is no footage of any of this incident, but there is these papers\nwhich they provided as proof that they received property to be used as evidence in the case. So one Pablo Escobar\nFold 2 mobile flip phone, AKA Samsung, and one Pablo Escobar\nGold 11 Pro mobile phone, AKA iPhone 11 pro. But hey, now you basically know the story. Yeah, pretty serious business out here, making videos about phones\nsometimes, you know? Apparently also, if this guy\nOlaf ever does get charged in the United States, then it&#39;s very likely my\nvideos would show up somewhere in those court documents, which is crazy. And also the phones that they\ntook may show up as evidence. But yeah, I do wanna get back\ninto a little more of the more investigative deep\ndive type of videos. Obviously the giant scams\ndon&#39;t happen very often, thankfully, in the tech world, but still they are fascinating\nstories when they do. And by the way, that&#39;s not the\nonly encounter that we&#39;ve had with the FBI in running\nthis YouTube channel, but that&#39;s another story for another day. But hey, if you want more\nfun stories like this one, let me know with the comments. But also the latest episode, the bonus episode of the Waveform podcast is just stories like this one\n(upbeat music) from the past couple years at the studio, whole story time episode. It&#39;s fun. So go over there and\nsubscribe and watch that. But yeah, that&#39;s basically it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (upbeat music) It&#39;s a story of how I became a villain. For at least 24 hours, I was hated. - A couple weeks, I would say. - Yeah, oh really? A couple weeks. Well, oh, &#39;cause the\nvideo had to come out. Hang on here for a second,\nI&#39;m gonna go get him. I literally wait there\nwith all my bags and stuff, and like this guy\ndisappears into this booth, comes back out with another guy. He goes, &quot;Hi. Oh, good to meet you.&quot; And he&#39;s filming me now. Okay. - Oh no. - So now he&#39;s filming me. A couple weeks later I log into YouTube, and everyone on Twitter&#39;s like, &quot;Why is Marques such a jerk?&quot;"

      "subtitles": "(upbeat music) - All right, Tim. - Great to see you. - Thanks for spending the time. - Thank you for coming. So you had the WWDC keynote today. - Yeah. - Which was really fun to\nwatch. It was a whole two hours. I wanna zoom all the way out, &#39;cause, obviously, a lot of\ntalk about AI in general. - [Tim] Yeah. - And I&#39;m kind of just left wondering how Apple defines AI in general, because I know, if you\nask a regular person, you might hear about\ngenerative AI, chat bots, things like that. - Yeah. - And these are relatively new additions to Apple&#39;s AI portfolio. How do you look at AI as Apple? - Well, we&#39;ve been executing\nwith AI for a long time. - [Marques] Right. - It&#39;s at the, you&#39;re wearing a watch. It&#39;s at the root of the watch. I mean, you think about\nthings like crash detection, fall detection, things like Afib, and all of this kind of stuff is machine learning at the end of the day, and so, but what has\ncaptured people&#39;s imagination is generative AI, and we\nsee it as the opportunity for a whole new curve of technology and providing and doing\nmore things for people, providing an assistant for people, things that really improve people&#39;s lives. So that&#39;s how we see it. Obviously, it&#39;s not without downside, and so we approach it very thoughtfully. - Sure. - And as you heard, we have\nalways been focused on privacy, and so privacy is a very key\ntenet of our thrust into AI. - Right. It&#39;s been interesting to\nwatch Apple&#39;s arc with AI. &#39;cause I made a whole piece,\nnot more than about a year ago, about how Apple seems to never say AI, even though they have\nall these neural engines and machine learning and things like that. - Yeah. - And so now we have almost this pivot, where now we&#39;re just saying it. We&#39;re actually branding\nit Apple Intelligence now. I&#39;m curious why that changed now. - Well, in the beginning, and throughout almost\neverything that we always do, we always talk about\nthe benefit to the user, and so the benefit to the user is crash detection and fall detection, not the technology behind the feature. - Sure. - And so we still view it like that, but it became clear that people wanted to know our views on generative AI in particular. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so we decided to embrace it and called it Apple Intelligence. - Okay. I have a quote from the Dua\nLipa interview that you did. - [Tim] Oh, okay. - [Marques] That was great. - [Tim] It was fun. She&#39;s fantastic. - I loved it. It was great. You had a quote that said, about AI, &quot;If it can be used for nefarious things, we won&#39;t go down that road.&quot; - Yeah. - And at the time, I assumed that that meant generative\nAI was off the table, &#39;cause of all the things\nthat we&#39;ve seen about what it was potentially capable of or things that it might do. Has that changed? Is that something that was off the table and you figured now\nyou&#39;ve got the right tools or the right restrictions to make sure that that\nall goes super well? How do you think about that? - Generative AI was never off the table. It was always about pursuing\nit in a thoughtful kind of way, and so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done, and we&#39;ve implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues. - How so? - How so? Well, things that, if you think about the kinds of things that we talked about, we talked about personal context and we talked about privacy,\nand so we are not waiting for a comprehensive privacy\nlegislation regulation to come into effect. We already view privacy as\na fundamental human right, and so that&#39;s the lens that we see it at, and given that we&#39;re doing those things, personal context and privacy, we wanted to integrate it at a deep level, so you&#39;re not having to think, &quot;Oh, well, now I want to do something that uses Intelligence.&quot; We put it into the apps\nthat you&#39;re already using. - Right. - And integrate it in deeply. - Right. Yeah. I think also, now, there&#39;s\na lot of talk about it now that there is generative AI. - [Tim] Yeah. - A lot of people have, I mean, Apple&#39;s notorious for never\nsending anything to the cloud. Everything&#39;s on device, because that is the most\nsecure way to do it, and was applauded for it. Interestingly, this is a\nlittle bit different now. With a lot of these larger\nmodels, more complex requests, you actually do have to\ngo off of the device, so you&#39;ve developed, I\nwanna get the name right. Private Cloud Compute.\n- Private Cloud Compute. - Explain this to us, because I think the\ngeneral chatter online is, well, they have to be sending\ndata to OpenAI, for example, to get a request back from ChatGPT. - Well, there&#39;s Private Cloud Compute, and then there&#39;s the\narrangement with OpenAI. These two things are different. - Okay. - And so if you look at\nPrivate Cloud Compute, we&#39;re utilizing the same\nsilicon, or not the same silicon, but the same basic architecture\nas the silicon that&#39;s in- - [Marques] Right. - Well, that&#39;s in the iPhone. - 15. Yeah, right. - And we&#39;re using the same software, and so we believe that\nwe&#39;ve done it in such a way that it&#39;s as safe and secure and private in the Private Cloud\nCompute as the device, and so we really worked on this a lot and put a lot of wood behind\nthat arrow to ensure that. If you&#39;re working on something that requires world knowledge,\nso you&#39;re out of the domain of personal context and so forth. - Yeah. - Then you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market, and we selected what\nwe feel is the best one with OpenAI and ChatGPT, but you&#39;ll make a conscious\ndecision to do that - Every time. - Every time. - So you can guarantee that there will never be\nany data sent to OpenAI without your explicit user- - That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. You decide. - Right. I also feel like there\nwas this blip on the radar of stand-alone AI devices, which\nI found really interesting. They didn&#39;t land too well. I think smartphones are pretty great, but there was an interesting\nconversation around that, about using your phone less, maybe having AI help you out in ways that let you spend less\ntime on the screen, and this is something you echoed also in the Dua Lipa interview. Like, if you&#39;re looking at your phone more than you&#39;re looking\nat someone else&#39;s eyes, something&#39;s off there. - Yeah. - Do you think there&#39;s a potential future where we&#39;re using our phones less because of how well\nthe Intelligence works? - I think it&#39;s a possibility\nand a significant possibility. I mean, for us, we&#39;ve never\nbeen motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices. Our model is not one that\nneeds engagement to succeed. Our model is one where\nwe want to empower you to be able to do things\nyou couldn&#39;t do otherwise. We want to give you a tool so\nyou can do incredible things that you couldn&#39;t do without the tool. That&#39;s what motivates us, and so, you know, we\ncome out with things like Screen Time, et cetera,\nso it&#39;s a bit in your face as to how much you&#39;re using your device. - True. - We come out with, we count\nyour notifications and so forth so that you can go in and say, &quot;Do I really want this\nmany notifications?&quot; And we have focus kinds of states where you can silence\nthe phone, et cetera, and so I do believe that, as things get smarter and\nsmarter with Apple Intelligence, that you can even take things\nthat were taking more time will take less time now. - Right. - And so I do think\nthat opportunity exists. - Interesting. Yeah. It&#39;s a curious future. - It is. It is, and I think I&#39;m\nreally optimistic about it. - Yeah. I also feel like there was tons of chatter when you were first CEO of Apple, about this new shift, obviously,\ncoming from Steve Jobs, and you&#39;ve been CEO for what\nfeels like a long time now, and we&#39;re entering this new age of AI, and I&#39;m curious now. Now, there&#39;s new chatter about who the next CEO is gonna be. What do you feel like your\nlegacy as CEO at Apple should be? - Yeah, Marques, I don&#39;t think about it. - Okay. - And so, to me, a legacy is\nsomething that is defined by other people looking at you, not something that you define yourself. - Very fair. - And so, and I typically am always\nfocused on the forward, not the rear-view mirror, and that is a characteristic\nof Apple in general, is we&#39;re very focused on the forward. You won&#39;t find a museum here, and yet we would have lots of things that you might like to\nsee and reminisce about, but we just don&#39;t. It&#39;s just not a part of our culture. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so I feel the same way personally. At some point, there will be another CEO, and my whole focus in life will be on making them successful. - Yeah. I like that answer. It&#39;s a very LeBron answer. I feel like he said something- - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. All right. I wanna end with a little game. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen these, where it&#39;s a blind ranking. Have you seen what these are? - A blind ranking? - A blind ranking. So we&#39;re gonna do a top five\nApple products of all time, but I&#39;m gonna give you them one at a time, and you don&#39;t know what\nthe rest of them are. So you have to rank the first one without knowing what two,\nthree, four, and five are. - Oh.\n- Okay. - And this is your ranking? - This will be your unofficial ranking, just based on your gut reaction of how you feel about the products. - All right, this is a tough one because- - It is a tough one. - It&#39;s like asking you your favorite kids or nephews or nieces. - We&#39;ll see how it goes. - Yeah. Okay, number one. MacBook Air. Had that iconic moment of, like, taking it out the envelope on stage. It&#39;s the most popular laptop\nin the world, I think. - It&#39;s the most popular in the world, and that moment of taking\nit out of the folder established a characteristic about that device that lives today. The first one, it wasn&#39;t about\nhow many people would buy it. - [Marques] Yeah. - It was about establishing\nthe foundation. - Was that the first Air product? - Of any line? - Yeah. It might have been. - I believe so. Yes. - Okay. - I believe so, and so I&#39;m gonna fail miserably\nat giving you a ranking, but it was a huge moment. - [Marques] Yeah. - A huge moment for the company. - The iPad. - Oh, wow. You know, tablets had been in\nthe market for a long time. Our objective is never to be first. Our objective is to be best. - I remember all the\nrumors leading up to it. - And there were many\nrumors leading up to it, and people thought many things that weren&#39;t too\nnice about it in the beginning, including the name, and yet I couldn&#39;t live\nwithout my iPad today. - [Marques] Yeah. - And so another huge\nmoment for the company. - My number three is the Magic Mouse. - The Magic Mouse. It was also an incredible moment. People don&#39;t think of that as much as they would the MacBook Air and the iPad and whatever else you&#39;re\ngoing to name probably, but getting the ergonomics well done was key. - With the Magic Mouse. - [Tim] Yeah. - Okay. Four out of five, the iPhone. - Oh my God. It changed the world. - It definitely changed the world. - It changed the world, and the simplicity of\ndefining the three things. - [Marques] Yeah. - That were on the phone was brilliant to get people to think about it like that, and, of course, opening up, this isn&#39;t talked about as much, but, initially, you&#39;ll remember that there was not an App Store. - Right. - The App Store came a year later, and that changed everything\nin the developer community, because, now, I meet\nwith students every WWDC, and they give me such great inspiration. There were no students in\nthe developer community at that particular point in time. Now, the developer\npopulation is very diverse from an age point of\nview and everything else, and it just, fundamentally, it became an economic miracle for people, and got well outside of\njust doing it for a hobby. You look at all the businesses\nthat came out of it. - Yeah, and now we have WWDC. - That&#39;s right. - Last but not least, Vision Pro. - Oh. I love Vision Pro. I was just using it last night\nto look at the screening. - Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for? I ask everybody who has\none what they use it for. - I use it for the entertainment value. I use it when I want to do multitasking, because I find the multiple windows really effective in doing this. Of course, I&#39;m reviewing\nlots of app on it right now, and some of those are enterprise apps, some people&#39;s proprietary apps that they wanna share with us, and I&#39;m seeing an extraordinary number and variety of things coming\nout of the enterprise area, far earlier than we would&#39;ve predicted. - Interesting. - Because businesses\ngenerally move slow to adopt. - [Marques] Yeah. - And what we&#39;re seeing is\nthat half of the Fortune 100 is now buying Vision Pro for\nsome project or the other, or exploring it. - [Marques] Interesting. - And so I&#39;m looking at\nseveral of those and, yeah, I find that it&#39;s still\nan emotional experience to look at your photos,\nand with visionOS 2, being able to take your old photos. - [Marques] Yeah. - [Tim] And make them 3D, I\nthink is a big, big thing. - [Marques] Yeah. - And, you know, I lost both of my parents before Vision Pro came out,\nand being able to go back and look at those photos differently is something that, you know, it&#39;s an experience you can&#39;t replicate. - For sure. Well, we didn&#39;t get a blind ranking, but we got a pretty good retrospective. - Yeah. - Of some of these products. Thanks again for your time.\n- Thank you. - Thank you.\n- I&#39;m looking forward to when the next feature\ndrops in the next WW, but this was fun. Thank you.\n- Yeah, it was great fun. Thank you for coming. - Same. (upbeat music)"
