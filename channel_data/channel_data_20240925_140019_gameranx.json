      "subtitles": "so state of play has hit and a lot of it has hit hard most stuff we have to talk about looks pretty sweet to me but this state of play was not without its controversy so without any further Ado hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 10 big new PlayStation state of play reveals in 2024 at number 10 is hell as us um what looks like Dark Souls against the Sonic Frontiers enemies is probably going to be a lot better than that we saw gameplay and honestly I&#39;m extremely intrigued I&#39;m also joking about the bad guys being the bad guys from Sonic Frontiers uh they are actually uh terrifying but kind of have that aesthetic seriously I&#39;ve had nightmares about things that look exactly like this so fun like that a lot get to play a video game against Nightmares I&#39;ve had the trailer uh while actually a Gameplay trailer does probably a better job of setting up a world and premise than most trailers I have seen lately what we have is a a realist action game that focuses on melee combat um I hesitate to call it a Souls like even though I have seen several articles call it such it looks a little different to me there&#39;s also a focus on exploration the marketing materials for hell as us uh regard it as an action adventure game which is not really what I consider a Souls game to be also so I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know exactly where to classify this if it fits in the sub genre or if it&#39;s something different altogether I think it&#39;s got enough going for it that it feels different i&#39; I&#39;m only mentioning this stuff because I&#39;ve seen other people mention it I wasn&#39;t immediately struck as oh look at this Souls like it has too much of a plot from the looks not that there&#39;s no plot in a soulslike game but generally those games are more environmental storytelling and this looks like you got a serious thing going on you know it&#39;s so silly that&#39;s how uh you would describe something unique about a game at this point because it sounds like such a dunk on the souls like genre and it&#39;s not at all but I&#39;m intrigued I like the idea of a surrealist game that doesn&#39;t lean too hard on like a novel art style really most of it aside from the bad guys is pretty normal looking and the bad guys actually kind of remind me of some control stuff I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I&#39;m fairly excited about this one it definitely roped me in we don&#39;t have a release date it&#39;s obviously a PlayStation 5 game and it&#39;s coming out next year sometime moving on to number nine here&#39;s where the controversy starts a little bit uh so they&#39;re releasing a chroma collection uh which is a couple of new controllers and console covers for the PS5 now if you&#39;re a fan of those reflective paint jobs that look like different colors from different angles you&#39;re going to love this I think they look cool I grew up in the 1990s that&#39;s when that stuff was cool your mileage may vary I don&#39;t know that&#39;s not what the controversy is the chroma collection is not going to be available for the launch PS5 and it kind of highlights the fact that the PlayStation 5 launch edition really hasn&#39;t gotten that kind of attention now to be fair there is positive response for these colors I&#39;m not saying that these are like hated they&#39;re not it is a cool announcement I do like what they look like but they&#39;re marred in the comment section of their announcement with people pretty not happy about the fact that these cool covers are only available for the PlayStation 5 Slim owners which is by the way somewhere in the neighborhood of 16 17 million people don&#39;t get me wrong lots of people but uh there are 45 million people who own the launch PlayStation 5 console which is a significantly larger number of people and thus uh when they see a smaller group being catered to it makes them not happy now the ideal solution to this situation is for Sony to put these covers out for the launch edition of the console as well but also maybe they don&#39;t want to maybe they want to produce less of them and sell them easier I I don&#39;t know there&#39;s probably a reason technically the original PS5 is not being manufactured anymore but people who supported the PS5 from day one feel a little short changed that being said I do want to say I think that they&#39;re cool covers I&#39;m talking about it this way because I think that it&#39;s only fair I don&#39;t have an original PS5 I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to buy these yet because I got I got my eye on that uh 30th anniversary edition if I&#39;m going to do anything crazy crazy about the appearance I&#39;m hoping maybe somebody makes a cover that looks like the 30th Anniversary Edition so I don&#39;t have to buy a really overpriced PS5 to get it but we&#39;ll see but obviously everybody who both owns the PS5 slim and likes those multicolor paints you got a great product coming up at number eight is the Stellar blade near automa DLC so let&#39;s get into some more straightforwardly uh awesome stuff right so there is blade DLC and updates uh they range from a photo studio H when I say photo studio I I say that as in it&#39;s much more than a photo mode and also uh near automa collaboration the photo Mode&#39;s kind of nuts like you go way further than your average photo mode you can um pose the characters you can put Expressions on their faces etc etc it&#39;s it&#39;s way more than you would normally expect but what is probably cooler for somebody like myself myself a big fan of near automa in all seriousness this is a game that Stellar blade got a massive amount of comparison to even though they&#39;re actually pretty different games now the nature of the near automa stuff I will say we don&#39;t know the full extent of it looks like it might be content where you play something from near automa with the Stellar blade uh mechanics I&#39;m not really 100% sure we do see 2 be facing over what looks like the crumbled amusement park from near aoma I don&#39;t know exactly what that means like are they going to put the near autom aesthetic over some areas of Stellar blade or are we getting a full new area we&#39;ll see it&#39;s awesome nonetheless uh there&#39;s also you&#39;re going to be able to buy the soundtrack for Stellar blade which is a very good soundtrack it is a lot of tracks also it&#39;s over 180 of them and I will certainly be picking that up and number seven uh this one I&#39;m pretty happy about Horizon zero Dawn remastered Horizon zero Dawn&#39;s a good game Horizon forbidden West is a big upgrade and burning Shores the DLC kind of takes us to a place where it makes the original Horizon look rudimentary and no longer this remaster looks fan freak tastic the trailer uh contains basically a list of things that they&#39;ve done to make things look better textures models blah blah blah I think that it&#39;s just obvious looking at it that it looks significantly nicer than the original Horizon Z da particularly the character models the original of those games character models kind of got some criticism uh as toe face they had a bit of that toe face the big toe face going on and I think they fixed that here it looks much more consistent with the more recent Horizon game or if you consider burning Shore as a separate game and I kind of do games I mean it&#39;s not like they&#39;ve done a huge amount of stuff to these models but even subtle changes do a fair amount in my opinion like if you look at uh side by side of the character models from the original to this trailer definitely improved adult aloy in particular like in that is kind of a night and day one and the thing is the original didn&#39;t look bad in any way and I never actually thought you know what really needs a remaster it&#39;s Horizon zero Dawn but uh seeing the footage that we&#39;ve seen captured on PS5 here yes it absolutely needed a remaster I can&#39;t wait to Play It Again honestly cuz it looks just stunning this one&#39;s not far off either it&#39;s coming Halloween this year pre-orders are open uh it&#39;s been nice to see Sony kind of actually developing on the horizon brand I think that it kind of got ignored a little bit when it first came out by a lot of people the toe faces I think didn&#39;t help this is a good choice and I do hope that it is well received because I would like to see them remaster more games uh bloodborne for instance would love to see bloodborne but yeah this looks good at number six we got some pretty sweet new footage of Monster Hunter wilds and a release date we saw a lot of interesting new environments some big new monsters but frankly we&#39;ve already been impressed by this new monster hunter game plenty we&#39;re way past the Shut Up And Take My Money stage of this one are we not I would assume so so when&#39;s it coming out when can I buy this thing when is it going to get into my grubby hands for me to play well Capcom finally told us is coming out February 28th next year and pre-orders are open and this is one that people are just straightforwardly psyched for every single bit of input I have seen on Monster Hunter Wilds has been positive I haven&#39;t seen too many people critical of it and when they are critical of it it&#39;s pretty light generally it just looks like a amazing new Monster Hunter uh game it looks huge like World it looks colorful like rise and it&#39;s gotten a huge upgrade to the graphics I have to assume everything about this game is poised to just be a big fraking hit at number five we got an announcement for a game called Arch age Chronicles now Arch age is is a game that came out quite a while ago it&#39;s an MMO RPG that they called a sand Park kind of a hybrid of a Sandbox game and a theme park I think actually a pretty good way of putting it I haven&#39;t played Arch age in a very long time but uh it came out back in uh 2013 in Korea and in the West in 2014 so it&#39;s been a while and in all seriousness this looks like a massive upgrade in graphics and systems and world and everything it is set 50 years after the original game so it&#39;s not just a rehash of the original which is nice I have to say in every way it does look like a AAA game I don&#39;t know exactly what that&#39;s going to add up to I have a feeling it&#39;s going to be pretty fun will it sustain itself that&#39;s always the question with these types of games I hope so uh because obviously I always hope for the best if it looks damn cool so yeah that&#39;s coming next year at number four we&#39;re getting Legacy of Kane Soul Reaver 1 and two remaster uh yes absolutely Absol freaking lutely we were just talking about this the other day I said something about how they&#39;ve made it seem increasingly unlikely they&#39;re ever going to give us a remake of these games and lo and behold ask and ye shall receive granted we were talking kind of about the legacy of Kane as a whole in the video where we were talking about games where it seems like the franchise is dead and we&#39;re not getting another entry of it I specifically mentioned Soul Reaver as games I&#39;d like to see remade in particular out of legacy of Kane they&#39;re really good games I love Soul Reaver they&#39;re pretty different from the other Legacy of cane games but I I I kind of don&#39;t care they were big hits and for good reason and man in all seriousness it was just one of those ones where I&#39;m just like yes absolutely and it&#39;s not even a long time we&#39;re going to wait for them they&#39;re coming to PS5 and PS4 December 10th moving on to number three it&#39;s Hitman world of assassination you might say to yourself wait that&#39;s already out and yes that is true you can buy Hitman world of assassination the trilogy of these games they are fantastic games they are third person games sandbox games and uh the announcement is actually for them coming to psvr with a ton of exclusive features and I don&#39;t know how I could possibly not want this it&#39;s everything thing that you kind of want Hitman to be you want to be the badass so now you get to go in dual wield guns do all of the actions with your hands I mean it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s hard to even describe how crazy it is like Hitman is such a varied sandbox oriented game to make it for VR and actually make it for VR not just make a a game where you can see from the perspective of the character but kind of rebuild the game from the ground up specifically for V r i mean that&#39;s freaking huge these are such good games and I I can&#39;t wait to play them honestly this is a good reason to own psvr and number two is the midnight walk um a PlayStation 5/ PlayStation VR2 game meaning uh you&#39;ll be able to play the game on either of these platforms I like that idea I&#39;m not sure exactly how necessary VR is for this because it is a highly stylized game and to be completely Frank it&#39;s very very neat looking uh I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s going to matter whether it&#39;s on psvr or not there is a lot to like about how this game looks VR might be slightly more interesting we&#39;ll see it&#39;s kind of because it it uses an emulated stop motion animation look for the movement of the characters and I don&#39;t know how well that will translate to directly to your eyeballs I&#39;m not super worried it&#39;s not like a major concern or anything but I think I&#39;ll probably get it on the PS5 rather than the VR I love it when VR is done right right but also I I do get sick playing the VR after a short period of time and I have some I have concerns about what that stop motion is going to do in that respect but man this is a cool looking game we don&#39;t have a release date or anything they&#39;re just saying spring 2025 but hey that&#39;s that&#39;s something to look forward to I definitely think and finally at number one this is the one that I&#39;ve been waiting to talk about this whole time ghost of yote the followup to Ghost of sushima it is a game set 329 years after the first game it had has a pretty different vibe in terms of its setup obviously we&#39;re still a samurai we still have swords etc etc it&#39;s a different time period but it&#39;s not a time period where modern technology has been introduced but it&#39;s an era where rather than Samurai Clans there were a lot of roaming Ronin so to speak a pretty different world you are one of those Ronin apparently you start off as a hunter around Mon yote and you very quickly become very wanted and the target of every Samurai in the area it looks really cool honestly of sushima is of course a fantastic game and this looks like a uh pretty cool followup in my opinion I don&#39;t know if this counts as a a spin-off or a sequel exactly obviously it takes place in the same continuity but I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a ghost of sushima 2 eventually or not if they&#39;re just going to focus on the ghost character this Ronin or samurai or whatever wearing a mask and doing secrety things and being contemplative on top of mountains and stuff I&#39;m just happy to see the series continue and this does look like a a great game in my opinion I&#39;m excited to see where it goes no release date but it&#39;s coming next year we&#39;ll keep you informed of everything we know as well we have a couple bonus things to mention here we got an overview trailer of Dynasty Warriors Origins the new Mainline Dynasty Warriors game it is not an open world game uh I think they probably could make an open world Dynasty Warriors that didn&#39;t suck it just would have to not be clearly intended to be an mmor RPG and they change direction that said Dynasty Warriors 9 sucked horribly it didn&#39;t focus on the things that make Dynasty Warriors great this looks like it&#39;s doing exactly that and it&#39;s doing it with a lot more power behind the games engine that is coming January 17th 2025 the expansion we have all been waiting for yes the night Springs DLC was a lot of fun not complaining but the Federal Bureau of control oriented Lakehouse expansion I am so there for the BC agent you see in Allan Wake Kyan Estes is in an adventure that actually uh happens parallel to Allen wake 2 and I think that&#39;s a great idea for what to do with this I I would like to know what the Federal Bureau of control is doing the whole time frankly I am a huge FBC uh Enthusiast let&#39;s say control is probably one of my favorite games of all time Allen wake 2 I think only outshines it on the basis that it manages to accomplish a lot more in terms of the world itself control is a huge winner also in the exact same way DLC served as an alen wake 2 teaser with control I think we&#39;re getting a control 2 teaser here as well as a an enjoyable expansion on what happened in uh the events of Allen wake 2 I I&#39;m super excited it&#39;s coming out in October we also got some new gameplay for towers of aaza a game uh that looks like an adventure game where you grow an ecosystem it&#39;s a very pretty looking game uh but I don&#39;t fully understand it quite yet you got Town building you got plant planting and a big old world to explore it does look very cool and I have to assume that uh it&#39;s going to be interesting but uh this is the first uh in-depth anything I&#39;ve seen of it it does look very cool and it&#39;s launching An Early Access in November we&#39;ll see exactly what happens with that one but that&#39;s also it for today if you like this video click like if you&#39;re not subscribed now is a great time to do so we upload brand new videos every of the week best way to see them first is

      "subtitles": "looking for a game that doesn&#39;t last you a bajillion hours something a little bit smaller scale not a massive open world but just a good linear Adventure well today we&#39;re talking about 20 linear single player games from throughout 20204 new and upcoming we got a bunch of games so let&#39;s just jump in with number 20 we&#39;re starting with an obvious it&#39;s the upcoming release of the Silent Hill 2 remake if you know anything about Silent Hill it&#39;s it&#39;s a survival horror game and with that comes a fair amount of linearity sure you can wander the foggy streets of Silent Hill but ultimately if it&#39;s anything like the original game it&#39;s a fairly linear Adventure at the time of making this video we still haven&#39;t seen this game we&#39;re really hoping for the best because we love classic Silent Hill hopefully they don&#39;t screw it up here but if they do nail it if they do knock it out of the park and successfully remake this original game chances are you&#39;ll have a good solid linear adventure to play through from beginning to end it&#39;s over you&#39;re not doing endless side quests that&#39;s it it&#39;s just cool again I&#39;m still not sure about this one but I really hope blubber team knocks it out of the park next over at number 19 we have children of the sun this is a devolver digital published game and from that you should know it&#39;s something different it&#39;s something unique it&#39;s a sniping game it&#39;s all about running around the outside of your enemy camp finding the perfect angle and taking the shot on your enemies here it&#39;s all about Flawless execution but there&#39;s really fun mechanics added like how you can control the bullet essentially it&#39;s it&#39;s more of a puzzle game than a shooter but it&#39;s got a lot of style and it&#39;s really cool and it&#39;s essentially structured in levels so it&#39;s a linear thing you play through but if you grew up playing games where you would choose the sniper rifle or maybe you played the silent scope games children of the sun is a really different Unique Kind of Indie style artsy spin on those Concepts and because of that it&#39;s absolutely awesome next over at number 18 we have black myth Wukong I will chalk this one up on the list of sort of kind of linear either way black myth Wukong is an absolutely fantastic action adventure game with cool combat really really compelling boss battles and an incredible visual style it&#39;s also a very straightforward game it is level based you play through a level you finish it you move on to the next area so that by definition is linear most of the time Blackmouth Wukong definitely opens up after about the third act and these levels go from tight Corridor hallway levels you know glorified worlds to absolutely massive more expansive explorable areas still there are diversions in these areas there are optional bosses and stuff like that it&#39;s still in my mind a linear game either way it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s absolutely an awesome one next over at number 17 we have Neva this is the next game from the people behind Gris a really interesting simple 2D Adventure that had beautiful art and music uh neeva seems to be taking it a step further add in combat an animal combat that seemingly grows with you along the adventure and is probably all going to make us cry at one point we don&#39;t know how open this game is it does seem from previews that it is going to be a fairly linear Adventure you just play through and finish and that&#39;s refreshing well know for sure when never releases October 15th next over at number 16 we have kitsugi path of the Goddess now if you like Capcom games I&#39;d say definitely take a peek at this one because they did something totally different instead of doing another big expansive big budget game kugami path of the Goddess is kind of a tower defense game there&#39;s a lot more to it than that like you have more agency as a player and as a character but it&#39;s just really unique surprisingly addictive and fun along with that you&#39;re playing through levels it&#39;s not a massive expansive thing it&#39;s just a good straightforward Adventure that can sometimes get pretty challenging as well next over at number 15 we have Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 HD uh this released for Nintendo switch earlier this year and it&#39;s a re-release of an incredible game Luigi&#39;s Mansion games are really really underrated by some they&#39;re just a blast and Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 continues that granted it is a HD re-release of a game from a handheld platform so there are some shortcomings but this more than any game on the list is just a good oldfashioned video game now next over at number 14 uh if we are are talking about Good oldfashioned video games we have to mention astrobot astrobot is a platformer where you jump into levels and you play through those levels and finish them in a linear fashion granted you do have some Choice as to which planet or which level you engage in you know it&#39;s up to you in terms of like what order you want to tackle all these levels But ultimately the game is structured in kind of like little nebulas where you go through you clear out all the planets you fight the boss then you move on to the next cluster of planets and we think it&#39;s one of the more fun simple Charming games released this year next over at number 13 we have Indiana Jones and the great circle this is by machine games the people behind the Wolfenstein games which are very very linear and they&#39;ve been upfront about Indiana Jones being a pretty linear experience as well there&#39;s going to be some Hub areas and some semi explorable areas but ultimately you&#39;re going through an Indiana Jones video game Adventure I really hope they nail this one because there was a time when Indiana Jones had a bunch of cool video games so I hope we can go back to that time if anything this kind of reminds me of Chronicles of Ric escape from butcher Bay that&#39;s kind of a deep cut but some of you older players will definitely know what I&#39;m talking about some of the people involved were involved in that game and this could be potentially very cool and very good for Indiana Jones fans next over at number 12 we have Indica which is a really really fascinating Adventure so you play as a nun in a kind of alternate industrialist Russia timeline and and you essentially Venture through a spooky Frozen land there&#39;s a lot more to it than that there&#39;s some story here and it&#39;s kind of like a mix between like a simple adventure maybe borderline walking simulator with some good shakeups as well as puzzle solving because Indica is cursed with kind of having a literal devil on her shoulder meaning she was kind of shunned by her convin and given a mission to go out into the world it it&#39;s so weird and quirky it&#39;s incredibly unique from the presentation to just the setup and it&#39;s not an open World adventure that&#39;s going to take you 80 hours next over at number 11 we have another remake it&#39;s it&#39;s the brothers A Tale of Two Sons uh this game from Haz light the people behind uh it takes two you know the game of the year winner from a few years back uh this is kind of like their humble beginnings where you play as two brothers you control both of them uh with the joysticks on your controller and it&#39;s a really good game I think because it doesn&#39;t outstay it&#39;s welcome you can finish it in like 3 4 hours and it&#39;s just like a well-crafted well-paced thing the re-release this year didn&#39;t get a ton of traction online but we&#39;re glad the game is available for modern platforms it&#39;s it&#39;s a really cool linear game to play through next over at number 10 we have Call of Duty Black Ops 6 specifically the campaign while you&#39;re probably going to have some degree of freedom in terms of choosing what to encounter next it&#39;s a first-person shooter campaign so by definition it&#39;s probably going to be fairly linear but we&#39;re really looking forward to it the Black Ops campaigns when they have campaigns uh definitely deliver they go a little bit more experimental a little bit stranger and we think that this one is probably going to continue that Trend the Cold War campaign did some really interesting things and we&#39;re hoping to see that continued here next over at number nine we have a quiet place the road ahead we don&#39;t have movie time in games as often as we used to and now a lot of the times when they release they&#39;re actually pretty decent and with a quiet place the road ahead it&#39;s being published by saber interactive who&#39;ve had a couple of good hits lately I think they know what they&#39;re doing most of the time and this is a firsters Adventure in the world of the quiet place it&#39;s a Survivor game you&#39;re trying to survive in a world invaded by deadly other worldly creatures that are attracted to sound so from what we can see here it seems like you&#39;re using a lot of the tricks from the movies to stay silent to get around safely it&#39;s not about killing these monsters it&#39;s about sneaking around them it&#39;s about finding objects and tricks in the environment to outwit and adapt and survive I don&#39;t know I hope it&#39;s really good I think quiet place is a really good interesting franchise and a video game version could be pretty cool and really help establish a little bit more of this post-apocalyptic World we&#39;ll know for sure when it releases October 17th next over at number eight we have still wakes the Deep this is a first-person Adventure that takes place on an oil rig in Scotland in the 70s a very unique setting for a very cool weird strange horror game you have some agency as a player but I would say gameplay-wise it&#39;s pretty straightforward it&#39;s called by the develop an immersive disaster story it&#39;s hard not to talk about this one without spoiling anything but it is an incredibly unique and creepy experience I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely different from other things you&#39;ve played this year and certainly one of the more unique horror experiences on this list it&#39;s linear it&#39;s straightforward it&#39;s pretty linear there are some distractions but really you can finish it in like four or five hours next over at number seven we have the recently released Plucky Squire a creative spin on Adventure platforming thanks to its art style its visual style the way it genuinely feels here like these 2D fun quirky story but characters can jump out of that book and continue adventuring it&#39;s a really really cool idea and it seems to be resonating with people especially if you&#39;re still in touch with your inner child uh here it&#39;s a pretty linear game you progress through and while there are some secret paths and stuff like that it could take you probably like 7 8 9 hours next over at number six we have the until da on remake this game is completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 it&#39;s a game I really really enjoyed upon release I actually remember doing the before you buy for it way back when I&#39;m like a 100 years old now but it&#39;s a game that I never expected to see a remake but here we are it&#39;s got support for modern features obviously better visuals and it&#39;s just a really good fun horror Adventure that wears its influences on its sleeves it is all about Choice it is all about timing these events but still it is like a playable movie you progress through so yeah I&#39;d say it&#39;s linear I don&#39;t know how the Remake will turn out but either way until dawn is worth playing we&#39;ll know whether or not the Remake is good when it releases October 4th of this year next over at number five speaking of remakes we have the Dead Rising Deluxe remaster now this one in terms of being a linear game is a little tricky I might be cheating here because it has a fully explorable mall with main missions side missions but the whole thing is structured around a deadline you have 72 hours in this mall to explore its Secrets save as many survivors as you can tackle sub objectives and optional bosses and uh yeah man it&#39;s really cool the Remake definitely has some issues I pointed them out in my before you bu if you&#39;re a Die Hard fan you might have some nitpicks but either way Dead Rising is just a game worth playing in general and yeah I&#39;ll say that having that 72-hour deadline having a time limit to you finishing everything because you need to get on the hel op to escape sort of it&#39;s just a really cool unique straightforward structure to a zombie game that you wouldn&#39;t really expect now next over at number four we&#39;re sticking with horror with alone in the dark yes the alone inth dark reboot or whatever you want to call it did release earlier this year it&#39;s kind of like a new creative imagining of the original game set into duretto mansion with Edward kby and unfortunately it does fall a little short it has a lot of creative elements and some cool level design But ultimately I was a bit mixed on it when it released still though it felt refreshing because it was just like a regular old school kind of survival horror game you just play through and finish there are two campaigns technically you can play as the two main characters you know kind of like a Leon and CLA situation definitely not as good the game definitely has some issues but if you&#39;re just looking for something a little bit different and just like a regular old horror Adventure in a spooky Mansion well alone in the dark&#39;s got you covered for that at least maybe if you get it on sale next over at number three we have hellblade 2 senua saga this is a really really linear game and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as the original hellblade I&#39;ll say that but if you are looking for an adventure to just get whisked away in and kind of turn off your brain a little bit uh the hellblade 2 is definitely good for that because it is so tightly linear there&#39;s not really an exploration you&#39;re constantly just pushing forward and it certainly has its flaws but it is still a beautiful Adventure with some really cool memorable moments it&#39;s also gory creepy and kind of weird which I certainly don&#39;t think is a bad thing next down at number two we have something really unique with tactical breach Wizards this recently released game is kind of like a uh XCOM where your fantasy wizards but don&#39;t worry it&#39;s actually kind of badass it&#39;s way cooler than you&#39;d think uh you&#39;re busting into places and taking out enemies in that XCOM turn-based strategy style you&#39;re using cover you&#39;re using the environment you&#39;re using your teammates all to outwit and defeat these enemies and it&#39;s cool as hell it&#39;s got a little bit of a stylized art style a little cartoony but it really can hit the turnbas tactics thing is always really fun and this is level based so you&#39;re playing through it you&#39;re having a good time it&#39;ll take you about 13 14 hours now down at number one we have Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 the single player campaign for this game is completely linear you play through an adventure as Demitri and Titus doing his Space Marine thing and it&#39;s cool as hell it definitely helps if you played the original game but either way this is a good fun adventure it gets a little zany gets a little video gamey towards the end but it&#39;s a good linear adventure with spectacle challenge some cool bosses and good pacing one moment you&#39;re fighting hordes and hordes of enemies in a massive open Battlefield and then the next you regrouping with your teammates back at base and then the next moment uh you&#39;re walking through creepy pitch black hallway is waiting for an enemy to strike there&#39;s just a lot of really good moments here and it&#39;s a ton of fun you can finish it anywhere from like 8 to 10 hours and it&#39;s cool as hell it&#39;s gotten a lot of people into Warhammer 40K and for good reason this is just a straight regular oldfashioned linear video game campaign granted there&#39;s all multiplayer and all that cool stuff but for the sake of this video yeah it&#39;s the campaign baby those are 20 linear or linear is single player games that we wanted to talk about today for 2024 I know there are more we couldn&#39;t squeeze them all in this list so we&#39;d love love to hear from you in the comments anything in particular you got something you want to talk about let us know what you&#39;re thinking let us know if you enjoyed these games or if you&#39;re playing any of them or looking forward to them clicking the like button helps us out cuz we put out videos every single day but as always thanks for watching and we&#39;ll see you guys next time"

      "subtitles": "some other guy has got something better than you just the facts of life right well some of us who play games get fairly green eyes fairly often hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 10 things that make every gamer jealous at number 10 is a kick-ass console or PC setup of course obviously the most basic dream of all Gamers to have the perfect space to do all your gaming you got a big TV bunch of monitors on your PC a big comfy PC chair all the purple gamer lights a Wann toe streamer could ever want blah blah blah there are some amazing setups online they&#39;re not hard to find there&#39;s an entire Reddit dedicated to this stuff actually multiple reddits they&#39;re pretty much the ubiquitous gamer dream we all want a big space lots of room for the consoles the PC equipment but it&#39;s a dream only a select few of us are actually capable of achieving the biggest issue is of course space most of us just game in the living room or our bedrooms but if you want the ultimate setup you&#39;re going to need a dedicated space for it especially if you&#39;re sharing the house with people who aren&#39;t into the IDE of covering walls with monitors and erecting giant shelves full of gaming detrus you need room for an office or a basement which means you need a big house or an apartment with a spare room in it which isn&#39;t exactly an achievable goal for everyone out there even if you do have the space actually going out and creating the perfect gamer cave isn&#39;t always easyier straightforward either it&#39;s a lot of work setting up and programming all those LEDs well it&#39;s actually supposedly relatively easy but that doesn&#39;t stop me from not knowing how to do it and it requires a level of dedication not only to learn but to execute and it&#39;s beyond dragging a couch into a room and buying a $100 TV off Amazon and once you get all of this stuff in your head and you&#39;re thinking about it like ah this would be good stuff there&#39;s always that guy you know who&#39;s already got it you&#39;ve been over to their house a bunch of times might be a guy might be girl I don&#39;t know but they got everything except for the simmering rage boiling up within you as you become increasingly Green With Envy they don&#39;t have that you have that they have all the stuff you want and number and uh I don&#39;t know this one might come off a little bit harsh but uh having a stable job in your 30s so you can actually afford games and buy everything you want remember when you were a kid and you had no money sure you might had free time but without that cold Hard Cash your gaming prospects were pretty limited you were stuck scrounging for cash doing odd jobs for elderly neighbors you know mowing grass raking leaves and of course the worst um printer stuff you skip lunch you save up lunch money and you sell off old games for pennies on the dollar so you can afford the next big game maybe that was your past maybe it&#39;s your present either way it sucks gaming is an expensive Hobby and sure there are ways around it now we&#39;ve got Game Pass and all those free games on the Epic store but some games are going to come around uh you just got to have right now there&#39;s no waiting for a sale it&#39;s not going to ever go on Game Pass it&#39;s R mature so your parents aren&#39;t going to buy for birthday or or let&#39;s say you&#39;re an adult and you just don&#39;t have any money not great going through all this turmoil to get a game is exhausting and and you got to be selective you can&#39;t just get anything you want you got to pin your hopes on one big purchase one special Hail Mary of Miracle Prayer then you find you just blew 60 bucks on a pile of crap that could have gone to something better Lord knows there&#39;s plenty of that nowadays hell7 $80 having no money is stressful that&#39;s why when we were all kids we were jealous of adult Gamers who could just buy whatever they wanted without a care that and the economy was a hell of a lot better back then I grew up in the&#39;80s and &#39;90s everybody&#39;s flushed with cash compared to now like there&#39;s a lot of people now that are of the age that they should be getting anything they want with their you know gainful employment but they&#39;re driving Uber and selling carpets and they&#39;re just not making any money it&#39;s hard out on them streets you know the joy of being an adult with an actually decent paying job is I mean just so much stress is gone I mean this all only applies if the adult in question isn&#39;t married or has major obligations like child support or an aging relative or a caretaker someone with disability all that adult money just goes right out the window trust me on that one for the few of us that are lucky to have money that we can just spend on games you got to try to remember what it was like when you were that kid or when you were poor like 3 or 4 years ago appreciate what you&#39;ve got man cuz it makes everybody else jealous moving on to number eight a uh massive inhome arcade this one is those ones that like maybe it&#39;s not practical maybe you don&#39;t need it but don&#39;t tell me that hasn&#39;t been a dream of yours at some point especially if you grew up in a certain era the era that I stated that I grew up in uh there&#39;s this nostalgic appeal of the arcade that cannot be overstated the dim lights the Disco Balls the squiggly pattern carpets the constant hum of screens trying to catch your attention and slices of pizza that cost way more than any slice of pizza ever had business costing our kids just really have this special place in many um I hate to say Elder Gamers Hearts but uh I guess that&#39;s the case a big part of what made them so special were the games that you could play in the arcades there were home versions of games they were usually inferior now as the years went on and consoles got better arcade games and their home ports were pretty much the same but there was something special about playing them on a proper arcade cabin like I I remember Street Fighter back in the day yeah I loved it on Super Nintendo but man going in the arcade and playing it where the Sprites were bigger and the sound was better and seemed more responsive and Super Nintendo was uh it could be fast but um Street Fighter 2 in the in the arcade was badass man and when you&#39;re a kid actually owning an arcade cabinet just one felt like an impossible dream it would take Richie Rich money blank check money to do that these days we know that arcade cabinets aren&#39;t really that expensive your classic cabinet sells for around 2,000 or 2500 bucks these days which is a lot of money but uh it&#39;s not like $2,000 or $2,500 back when arcades were a thing before you know 30 years of inflation I mean owning a cabinet isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility for a lot of people uh but owning an entire collection of them that is it&#39;s out of it&#39;s it&#39;s out of the question I&#39;m not buying an arcade cabinet anytime soon I&#39;ll tell you that that&#39;s a lot of money that frankly I don&#39;t have so when you see these things about people who build an entire arcade in their home it&#39;s hard not to be jealous just having all those big boxes all to yourself getting the Vibes of the arcade without the Bo and the beer stick H that would be great you need a big house to pull it off which is I mean kind of makes sense cuz you&#39;re buying like multiple $2,500 things just to have around the old 1,800 Square footer ain&#39;t going to do that not if you got kids or a partner or roommates or or whatever like can you honestly imagine having like 10 or 20 or 30 arcade games in your house that&#39;s like tens of thousands of dollars I&#39;m not going to do the math but that&#39;s a lot of money it&#39;s something that most gamers are never going to be able to see and also maybe even just willing to spend the money on something that is ultimately pretty frivolous there is a hidden cost as well you&#39;re not just building an arcade you have to maintain it as well a lot of these old arcade games are well old and require repairs it&#39;s kind of like most of those like Golden Era games or CRTs as well which are notoriously difficult to repair and should really only be attempted by professionals like messing with a CRT is honestly dangerous the shock from them can be fatal working on an arcade cabinet isn&#39;t just something any casual Enthusiast can just do so that&#39;s another massive expense combined with a lot of potential headaches there so yeah owning an in-house arcade probably more of a pain in the ass than it&#39;s worth at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m telling myself moving on to number 7 it&#39;s gigantic game collection if you&#39;ve seen any video game channel on YouTube with some kind of retr focus you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about the giant wall of games in the background shelves on top of shelves of every possible game imaginable these guys have done it they have the gigantic game collection TM they&#39;ve got complete console collections they&#39;ve got the rarest and most obscure games they&#39;ve got easy access to all of them if you got any kind of collector&#39;s mindset it&#39;s hard not to be jealous of these dragons hordes of games cuz building a collection like that is not easy or cheap especially anymore like if you&#39;re getting into game collecting now you&#39;re going to be envious of the people who got their foot in the door early or rather should I say bought video game systems and games when they were one generation obsolete during the 9s and early 2000s like seriously you could get NES and SNES and Genesis and PlayStation one you could get it all dirt cheap back then it was common to find the stuff getting sold for pennies at like local game stores or swap meets or the more enterprising Among Us got to Craigslist first also uh also I want to note I saw a comment on a recent video saying that you guys think I&#39;m 50 based on the cultural stuff I grew up in the &#39; 80s and &#39;90s I&#39;m not 50 I&#39;m 40 I keep saying I&#39;m old but I mean in gamer years and when I get to 50 it&#39;s going to be the new 30 okay let&#39;s back off that a bit guys but yeah talking about the passage of time everything is expensive you might get lucky once in a while using Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist which is actually still around something like that there&#39;s other things too like there&#39;s local ones for various cities and municipalities but in general retro game prices of Skyrock rocketed so building a proper collection is going to be a costly and frustrating Endeavor it&#39;s kind of morbid but we kind of have to wait for the big time collectors to croak so all their games flood the market maybe then collecting games will be a little cheaper again even if you know that&#39;s more of me trying to logic out a way for Game Collection to become cheaper again I don&#39;t think that will actually make it cheaper now that I think about it and number six the lucky ones who play a game at the height of its popularity finally something that&#39;s not at entirely money related obviously when you buy a brand new game that&#39;s probably when it&#39;s most likely to be popular and it costs more then but let&#39;s put that aside if you&#39;re into multiplayer games or MMOs or online games of any type the specific type of jealousy is definitely hit you once or twice it really sucks when you hear like a ton about a game and you don&#39;t have the money uh or proper rig to buy it at the time so you have to wait all you can do is read about the cool stuff going on in the game and it only gets you more hype to finally jump in but when you do the ser servers are a ghost town only most hardcore players are still around and want nothing to do with you and all your friends have already moved on anyone who gets to a game on the tail end of its popularity knows this phenomenon well the problem with online games is they are not Eternal they&#39;re entirely dependent around the community around them and once that Community is gone there&#39;s not really anything left to keep it going like somebody who&#39;s read all those exciting stories about Eve online about the massive Wars between huge corporations all the politics and scheming going on behind the scenes they&#39;re going to be kind of disappointed with the game now it&#39;s not dead but it&#39;s definitely not as active as it was in its Heyday The Glory Days are behind us and anyone who starts playing now is going to feel that Pang of Envy when they read about the Epic clashes that went down in the game in the past so many MMOs that are still around in some form had thriving communities in the past but are now just a shadow of their former selves you can still play them of course but the social experience is just entirely different instead of enjoying the game as it was meant to be played with an Engaged friend group you&#39;re just wandering around solo well Bots spam the general chat there&#39;s few desperate stragglers around trying to show they&#39;re epen but that really doesn&#39;t do anything but make you seem like you got no real peen there&#39;s just no turning back the hands of time you&#39;ll never be able to relive The Glory Days and for those of us that missed out it&#39;s it&#39;s hard not to be jealous of the people who were there for the good times number five is when you have the free time to actually clear out your backlog being an adult isn&#39;t all sunshine and rainbows it&#39;s awesome to wake up and realize oh man I just buy stuff I want I&#39;m not dirt poor anymore or at least I&#39;m not as dirt poor as I was it&#39;s easy to get Gams and with the Advent of steam sales and humble bundles and epic giveaways and just straight up free games it&#39;s pretty easy to build up collection of digital games nowadays having all that stuff is easy actually playing it isn&#39;t when we were kids it sounded like the best problem to have oh yeah I got too many games ah dang what am I ever going to do ah but what started out as a funny thing to complain about has evolved into a problem that legitimately stresses a lot lot of people out H backlog doesn&#39;t necessarily mean games you&#39;ve bought so this isn&#39;t necessarily a money one yeah it&#39;s a very minor problem my backlog is too big that&#39;s kind of lame to complain about but uh some people struggle to finish games they can&#39;t focus on a single thing or once their brains are too fried after a long day of work for instance to concentrate on playing something that&#39;s you know mentally demanding we want to play all the games we own but we don&#39;t have the time or Focus to do it and let&#39;s face it they&#39;ve created a situation that is kind of like the subscription problem where you got 500 subscriptions to 500 different streaming services the more of them you have it seems like the less likely you are to watch anything on any of them yeah it&#39;s just like that but with games at a certain point you&#39;re going to look at people with small or no backlogs with some degree of jealousy you&#39;re going to be envious of people who retired early or got a massive inheritance and don&#39;t need to work a day in their lives or just more uh basically they don&#39;t have to work long hours or have a lot of commitments pour one out for the adult gamer with kids it&#39;s easier as they get older but the gaming time is it&#39;s never going to be the same as somebody who gets a pretty fair amount of time for gaming as it is essentially my job I do not have a cleared backlog and if somebody whose job is to play video games and talk about it observe report Etc if we can&#39;t clear out a log I don&#39;t know who really can like it it&#39;s got to be somebody who doesn&#39;t have to work at all like you play games for a job you still have to do the job part if you play games because you don&#39;t need a job it&#39;s just the game part I&#39;m jealous of that I&#39;m sure you&#39;re jealous of me because I get to play games for a living but it&#39;s not all just that aspect like there&#39;s a lot of other things that go into this but believe me I sympathize I haven&#39;t always been this fortunate and I will again thank you all for the ability to do this as a job you are fantastic people don&#39;t eat me Falcon is it&#39;s a it&#39;s not as good as chicken I promise I don&#39;t don&#39;t ask how I know that and number four is skilled PC Builders and electrical engineers who can easily fix things if you&#39;re not the technically inclined type it&#39;s inevitable you&#39;re going to be jealous of the gamers who are capable of making their own repairs no matter what kind of electronics you own repairs are costly and frankly infuriating you have to deal with crappy customer service you have to package things ship them it&#39;ll be gone for weeks and when it does finally come back there&#39;s no guarantee it&#39;s going to work I&#39;ve sent stuff to be repaired and it did literally nothing trying to get your stuff fixed can just be a nightmare it would be easier if you could just fix it yourself right you could troubleshoot you crack open cases with and have the proper tools know what the proper tools even are you could open things up without breaking anything you can check traces repair connections you could use a so so soldering a soldering iron it&#39;s that&#39;s how to say it right I know it&#39;s not soldiering iron it better not be and let&#39;s not talk about multimeters I I don&#39;t know what their use is even forget schematics I&#39;m not there I can you know kind of work on stuff but there&#39;s a pretty nonzero chance I will break the thing that I am trying to fix so I don&#39;t just being able to do something like repair stick drift on a switch with a simple mod that would be a nice skill to have that&#39;s a little lower level right but some people seem to just be able to do anything I&#39;ve seen this guy who&#39;s into repairing old PCS and he was able to build a new PCI card from scratch he sourced all the capacitors and the chips reverse engineered the entire thing created a blueprint and had a company print the boards out for them I don&#39;t need that I I would like basic repair skills I mean at least it&#39;s easier to do stuff like that with YouTube tutorials having a video to work off of when you&#39;re repairing something it&#39;s definitely helpful I&#39;ve replaced a few batteries that uh I shouldn&#39;t have any business doing anything like that thanks to YouTube videos but uh yeah I&#39;ll admit it I&#39;m a little jealous of the guys that make those videos because uh they know all of that stuff and number three having these skill s and patience to turn your dream game into reality everyone wants to be a game designer I have tried many times to learn I&#39;ve put lots of effort into it probably the amount of effort that somebody who gets it would need to put into it in order to do it but to make a game you need a programmer you need artist you need musician and if you&#39;re going to do all of that yourself like a number of indie game makers have done in recent years people have become very very wealthy like the undertale guy he&#39;s all things just one of those things is Out Of Reach for most of us let alone all three making games is hard as hell I bet the majority of people who play games have at least dabbled in some kind of game making tool and kicked around the idea of making a game we&#39;ve all got that dream game in our heads the culmination of all things we like in games or just that idea we think nobody&#39;s ever done before or done properly very few of us ever actually make the game though cuz seriously it&#39;s incredibly hard even people with everything working for them struggle and burn out making games so it&#39;s all the more impressive when somebody manages to make something and put it out in the world it&#39;s especially impressive when it&#39;s just like one person I mentioned uh Toby Fox the undertale guy uh but there&#39;s also like Tom Francis who made gunpoint and uh the recent and awesome tactical breach Wizards those guys were able to turn their dreams into reality not just that they actually turn their hobby into a successful career like the stardew valley guy is like tens of millions of dollars now lots of money and if he&#39;s a Savvy man he has invested and has significant ly more than we know hard not to be a little jealous of the possibilities forget the success though just making the games we&#39;re all Gamers we all want to make games it would be nice to get some recognition for a great idea you know the hard part&#39;s doing it and number two people who can read Japanese these days pretty much everything gets some kind of localization and if not some enterprising fan will do it instead but way back the only way any of us were ever going to get the chance to play untranslated games is if we could read Japanese that was the only way I remember looking on in Envy at people who got to play Demon Souls back then it was never clear if it was going to come to the US it did of course but uh let&#39;s go ahead and bring up Mother 3 right that game went untranslated for years and a dedicated fan is the one who did it Nintendo still hasn&#39;t done that some games are stuck in Japan for decades the second Ace investigations game just now got an official translation in 2024 more than 10 years after it came out in Japan it used to be Japan was kind of a mythological place full of games we just couldn&#39;t play so anyone who could actually speak the language had access to a whole lot of games we could only look at screenshots of and go H famitsu huh that&#39;s how I say it did you know that only 258 Saturn games came out in the US the Sega Saturn in Japan got roughly 1,000 more 1,265 games the vast majority of that library is Japan only and many of its more interesting games have never been translated if you&#39;re really into schms and jrpgs you&#39;re going to be jealous of people who can can actually uh speak Japanese look at me I&#39;m failing in English here and finally at number one an entire Warehouse full of sealed games there&#39;s your standard game collector we&#39;re all jealous of was talking about him a few minutes ago then there&#39;s this the true motherload an entire Warehouse full of unopened games and consoles that&#39;s a real Pie in the Sky dream right there not just a wall of games but a whole building that&#39;s just wall to--all games that are all in pristine condition remember that old game show Supermarket Suite if if you don&#39;t I don&#39;t blame you I&#39;m old I would take something like that though but for this Warehouse all I need is a shopping cart in 5 minutes and I I&#39;ll rans sack this freaking joint I guess that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s in an undisclosed location seriously they brought some YouTubers in to check it out and made them not reveal this location like it&#39;s the warehouse where they dump the Arc of the Covenant at the end of Raiders in fact if any of you ever get to go there maybe keep your eyes out I&#39;m sure that&#39;s pretty valuable I mean we&#39;re talking like Commodore 64 nonsense yeah I was wasn&#39;t kidding I said I said I was old but uh there was a place called computer reset Warehouse it was literally wall to--all old school PC stuff going way back to the even the 80s covering the whole spectrum of condition they had pallets full of stuff that was like new next to literal garbage it was a total mess but man that would have been a cool place to explore if you&#39;re a retro PC guy sure you can be jealous of people who have the resources to own a a warehouse full of stuff but my jealousy is a little more mundane I&#39;m jealous of people who are lucky enough to even check these places out I do have one bonus for you and it was probably the thing that you thought of first if you&#39;re even remotely um inclined uh but a proper gamer girlfriend Andor boyfriend just throwing this one out uh let&#39;s be real it&#39;s the ultimate source of jealousy for a lot of Gamers the dream is getting a significant other who&#39;s as into your dumb hobby as you are really that goes for any hobby but gaming is it&#39;s it&#39;s the the struggle is real let&#39;s say for many reasons it&#39;s not something that&#39;s all that common I don&#39;t want to get into a bunch of dumb gender stuff here because it never gets weird and uncomfortable men like this women like this blah blah blah blah is it nature or is it nurture it&#39;s probably nurture let&#39;s be be frank but it doesn&#39;t really matter it&#39;s a fact of life every gamer wants a gamer significant other for obvious reasons but only the lucky few really get to have one and that&#39;s all all I&#39;ve

      "subtitles": "single player games are often packed with content a lot of the time they feel like they have to justify the price tag by giving you more but in truth that doesn&#39;t really justify the price eg a lot of that more is stuff you don&#39;t want to bother with and it kind of gets just left in the dust as you do the stuff that&#39;s fun if possible anyway hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 10 things you just leave unfinished in single player games let&#39;s start off with number 10 side quests and I don&#39;t mean all of them obviously there are games with very good side quests but let&#39;s let&#39;s entertain this scenario you&#39;re walking along the path minding your own business and then some desperate NPC runs up to you Bandits kidnapped my baby please help me if you help me I shall reward you with 400 coins I have 400 coins sir this is Tony Hawk Underground and I am trying to do a mctwist over the helicopter in Hawaii thank you very much I do not need 400 coins H I am also dying of the super flu and need 100 herbs you can collect 50 of them on this side of that wall that comes down when you do a 1080 mcloven off of a kickflip but you have to get to the other side of that wall to get all of the herbs I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just playing up how absurd side quest can be I should probably get back to talking about them um anyway you skip through all that stupid dialogue and find the fastest way to accept the request you know because it&#39;s the only way to end that conversation and sometimes you&#39;re like like ah yeah sure I&#39;ll help that guy out he&#39;s got the super flu and his something was kidnapped I don&#39;t know that was a long time ago he talked a lot and then you go collect the herbs and then this is just what I [Applause] need it turns into oh it&#39;s not just the herbs you also need another ingredient and then five ingredients later you need to get like a cauldron to make it all into a soup or some crap but wait the bandits that kidnapped whoever are also the ones with the cauldron so you have to do all of the kidnapping quest line thing it&#39;s just it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot so you have this in addition to all of your actual real quests that progress the story and matter a and then there&#39;s also the side quests that don&#39;t suck so you end up getting wrapped up in something else and you forget here&#39;s the thing most people just don&#39;t bother with side quests I mean hell 14% of players have competed even 10 quests in Skyrim special edition that means 86% players never even bothered with most of the quests forget side quest quests in the game there&#39;s over 700 of them so most people who played Skyrim are barely scratching the service that&#39;s a lot of broken lives with you know super flu and kidnapped children or whatever like maybe if these NPCs were a little more proactive they wouldn&#39;t be in this mess in the first place uh like think about it maybe don&#39;t hang around Bandits if you&#39;ve got a a a a baby you never know what Bandits are going to do also stop talking like that like they get actors who try to add flavor to these Side characters and it&#39;s always it&#39;s always just too much obviously there are exceptions technically the entire bloody Baron thing in The Witcher is a side quest and it feels as important if not more important than the main quest in that game but games that actually get it in that way like on that level especially do not come around often most of the time side quests are basic throwaway stuff that they try to guilt you into doing with some crazy like uh soab story it&#39;s just stupid I hate them I don&#39;t bother with them the lands are such fertile ground for games the inhabitants are so oish you can fill your pockets with hardly any efforts are you going to give us what&#39;s rightfully ours or do we need to start a new game and number nine is optional bosses in a lot of like Souls likes there are extra bosses and they are in fact the reward they&#39;re the reason you&#39;re playing the game but sometimes I can&#39;t be bothered you know how it goes sometimes you you wander down some path you run into a boss and you just turn around yeah I don&#39;t have the patience for this right now there&#39;s other things I want to do in the game etc etc this can be a problem in Souls likes where bosses are considered like the candy part but it&#39;s especially bad when you&#39;re not playing a souls likee and random boss pops up and you don&#39;t want to engage with it I don&#39;t have to fight it right now most the time rewards are barely worth the effort so why bother right a lot of the best fights in particularly Souls Lex but Metroid vanas and stuff like that they&#39;re optional but there comes a time when you&#39;re just kind of like all right you want to get to the next part of the game like there are things that happen in games that carry some sort of narrative weight that you know you want to get to and let&#39;s face it the Moss golum is not going to be super different from the sand golum right he&#39;s going to be weak to something different sure but it&#39;s not always exactly inspired let&#39;s say even for the most dedicated Souls player there comes a time when the answer is just no no more it&#39;s optional it doesn&#39;t matter at all so if you leave it unfinished and hell you can lie about it no one has to know the terrible truth that you skipped the boss in a Souls game or any game and number eight is the Collectibles so many games tease us with a completion challenge we&#39;re aware at pretty much all times just how little of the actual game we&#39;ve completed very few people get 100% most people just don&#39;t try I don&#39;t it&#39;s tedious as hell and takes forever to do and usually you have to do a bunch of stuff that sucks there&#39;s a reason not to many people make collectathon Platformers anymore and it&#39;s because the collectible thing has basically been used and abused by every genre in order to pad out the achievements must so some it&#39;s a mechanic that has been run into the ground for what I would call unsavory purposes laziness particular one of the seven deadly sins is sloth and and I swear to God the fact I can&#39;t 100% Assassin&#39;s Creed without filling up eto&#39;s little brother&#39;s box with feathers or whatever there&#39;s like a hundred of them they&#39;re scattered all over the place you want to know how little I need feathers to be an assassin am I saying it&#39;s impossible to kill somebody with a feather no I I I think probably some enterprising assassin who&#39;s extra clever can probably do that somewhere in the world but Assassin&#39;s Creed is not one of those places um I&#39;m trying to be an assassin here why are you asking me for a 100 feathers what is that imagine if somebody did that in real life went up to somebody coldhearted enough to be part of a killing organization and be like hey can you give me a bunch of feathers please in video games we just take being a kleptomaniac hoarder for granted picking up every coin we see and adding it to the treasure hord and like I said collectons were a genre of games that were all about that but it&#39;s just not fun anymore as a like full game concept when you&#39;re asked to go out and get 900 cororo seeds or whatever a rare few are mad as a Hatter and actually try to get everything in these games you really have to be when you basically get nothing for your efforts you do the cororo one you get like a golden turd and I&#39;m not joking it is a golden turd uh but at least at least those games kind of acknowledge how unlikely it is to get all that stuff by not hiding something serious behind it but then there&#39;s Batman Arkham Knight which doesn&#39;t let you get the actual ending of the game until you get all 243 Riddler trophies on top of everything else in the game you&#39;re supposed to be Batman the cape Crusader the iron Vengeance guy but by the end of the game you&#39;re wandering around like uh one of those guys that&#39;s really into geocaches like you ever you ever seen those guys they&#39;re not very Batman like like the vast vast majority of people never actually do all this stuff as much as that completion percentage bothers the OCD gamer mind actually taking the time to get everything is so boring and tedious only the most determined with the least amount of things to do in real life are willing to do it [Music] and number seven is your house you know how it goes you&#39;re playing a game you unlock a house or a settlement or whatever you get a building ability right maybe it&#39;s a survival game you can build stuff by default doesn&#39;t really matter how it starts but always ends the same way you go in with good intentions you&#39;re can to clean up the farm rebuild a settlement recruit all the NPCs and whatnot this game&#39;s going to be different I&#39;m not going to uh neglect this place in fact I&#39;m going to make it fancy I&#39;m going to build the ultimate house it&#39;s going to be awesome and then you spend a few minutes on it and you&#39;re like ah this isn&#39;t really why I bought this game is it this is a firstperson shooter why am I doing this so yeah instead of the opulent Mansion you wanted the rest of the game you&#39;re kind of running back to your pathetic little one room Shack that has a treasure chest in it to dump off your excess inventory because that&#39;s the only way to actually keep it safe it&#39;s got to be inside some walls right like I&#39;m not saying building in games can&#39;t be satisfying it can there are certain games that actually feel good to do this in despite the fact that there&#39;s the whole rest of the game there for you to do but a lot of the time it&#39;s a really timeconsuming distraction that it&#39;s not really that worthwhile depending on what kind of player you are you may not have the patience or creative drive to spend time building a proper settlement and you literally do what the game requires you to do before you can stop messing with that mechanic a hand and number six and this is going to sound unnecessarily General but you&#39;ll get it by the end uh anything where you actually have to think for those of us who are doing side quest sometimes you reach a point where they&#39;re bridge too far and this is that point when a game doesn&#39;t just roly tell you where to go and what to do it makes you think and engage in a way that isn&#39;t really worth it for what you&#39;re doing and sometimes uh you turn on a game that&#39;s not about thinking and they give you like a murder mystery to solve like when you should be out clearing Outpost or some some [\u00a0__\u00a0] and the thing is H you find out who the Killer is and you stop him and what effect does it have on anything nothing like you got some item or something maybe hey feel like solving a murder I&#39;m the Mur commcial around these parts uh one of these gutter quadruplets pulled the trigger on that boy over there consider yourself deputized there are a lot of games that I play where the main quest line does actually involve thinking but there are stakes and reasons why that thinking is satisfying to do because it brings you to your objective and rewards you and then of course there&#39;s a lot of games that I am playing not to think at all but uh you know I I don&#39;t want to you know solve some randoms incredibly complic ated problems for no for no real reward I just don&#39;t want to which of these four guys is telling the truth and which is lying well uh eeny meeny miny mo it&#39;s that guy sorry if you&#39;re innocent you&#39;re going to jail I&#39;m moving on that&#39;s just what happens when you ask some random off the street to deal with your life and death dilemma NPCs sure it&#39;s fun sometimes I I mentioned the Bloody Baron side quest in a different example for a different reason this has elements of that type of quest quest in it and it&#39;s amazingly rewarding to complete particularly from a narrative perspective which normally side quests are not like that but again there&#39;s a reason why everyone points at the Bloody Baron as an incredible example of a side quest it&#39;s because there are almost no other ones that are at that level in any game and number five is relationship values you know how in a lot of RPGs there&#39;s always some kind of measurement of how much your party members like you like in Dragon Age and Fallout you have the sort of a approval ratings in Persona you have the Social Links for the social butterfly gamer these things are something to eat up like catnip but for a lot of other Gamers the relationship building stuff gets in the way of what we&#39;re actually here to do which is Bonk monsters on the head with swords I&#39;ll admit that the Persona social link stuff I think is the exception that really gets me involved I like how you get new moves and stuff for doing it and often it does change the narrative even in like Fallout and stuff but I totally get why people don&#39;t do it I don&#39;t do it in most other games often I ignore personal quests like the plague I&#39;m just not interested unless they really made a good character and whatever they have going on is actually genuinely interesting I&#39;m not generally going to do these things what I hate though is when you do that and it leaves like somebody sidelined for the rest of the game man I sure hope none of this matters in the end right boy that would suck if in the last 5 minutes of the game my entire party turns out uh to hate my guts and not want to do anything anything with me that wouldn&#39;t be a fun surprise oh yeah that actually happens in never winter Nights by the way half your party will turn on you if your relationship with them isn&#39;t good enough there&#39;s just no time for personal quests in Mass Effect 2 you got to do the suicide mission as soon as possible what could possibly go wrong oh that&#39;s right tally just melted in a pipe my bad building relationships in RPGs is one of those things you&#39;re either 100% into or don&#39;t care about at all um I generally like it when it&#39;s just built into the story and happens like I don&#39;t have to make iten happen it doesn&#39;t divert me away from the main quest to develop the relationships between the various characters in my party I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no game that does this that I don&#39;t like I mentioned persona but even with that it&#39;s an exercise and optimization you really have to go way out of your way to max out all the Social Links I generally just go for the Social Links that are with the most interesting characters and get me the best moves that I&#39;ll actually use in my party like building relationships in RPGs in my opinion is just happen narratively speaking and giving you a penalty because you didn&#39;t want to bother with it kind of sucks when it comes back and bites you in the butt and number four the main quest I&#39;m going to bring up the damn bloody Baron again all right so Tris is waiting to meet you in novag grad right that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do but damn if fil Margera in a medieval red coat isn&#39;t more interesting legitimately the Bloody Baron is such a good side quest it feels like it is absolutely necessary more than anything anything else you&#39;re doing at the moment and that includes all the main stuff in the game it&#39;s such a complex set of relationships that you don&#39;t really know what the good thing to do is and it has you doing such weird crap it&#39;s of course not like the only example uh like Nakamura might be waiting for you at dinner and maybe the gang&#39;s patiently waiting for Arthur to come back after wandering off at the second chapter 2 started I don&#39;t know depending on what type of game we&#39;re talking about here the main quest can uh get neglected take any open world game like with sandbox elements for most players the story of a GTA game ends the second you&#39;re done with the tutorial I&#39;m not saying that this is me I have most certainly gotten CJ&#39;s brother out of prison every time I played Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but I know what Grand Theft Auto is and I completely get it when people don&#39;t like does John marsten really ever need to reunite with his family I don&#39;t know that ends everything so maybe not does Etso need to form that Brotherhood you get through the opening section and the story is is just in Eternal stasis from that point forward you screw around in the open world you cause chaos clear out a few camps and then put the game away if a game&#39;s got a compelling enough open world it&#39;s just more fun to screw around and do sides up like I said earlier 14% of Skyrim users ever complete more than 10 quests there&#39;s a reason for that even when the story&#39;s good sometimes you just want to play Cowboy for a few minutes and shut the game off and number three is bonus dungeons ah I&#39;ve almost be in the game now I just want to wander around the map see what I missed oh what&#39;s this 100 Floor dungeon filled with enemies harder and the last boss takes 4 hours to beat how many save points are there oh none you say if I die I have to restart the whole thing yeah screw that um Tower in breath of the wild I screw it just absolutely screw it I&#39;ve tried and then I&#39;ve died and then after I lose enough of that progress I&#39;m done sure hardest challenge in the game My reward might be bragging rights or the Ultimate Sword or whatever the game&#39;s already beaten I&#39;m already done I&#39;m already done with the game most of the time the bonus dungeons aren&#39;t even fun a lot of time they&#39;re just artlessly inserted into re-released games to put another bullet point on the back cover and they&#39;re not fun they just reuse assets from the rest of the game there&#39;s nothing new or interesting to find they&#39;re extremely long they&#39;re tedious and they add basically nothing to the experience but make it longer it&#39;s not always the case of course but there&#39;s no Bloody Baron of the bonus Tower with 100 floors all right it&#39;s never that good I&#39;m not wasting 15 extra hours playing boring content in the game I&#39;ve got a game for every floor in the tower in my backlog to at least try and number two is the DLC most people don&#39;t buy the DLC for games right look at the completion rates of DLC only achievements in most games it&#39;s usually close to zero I played the bolt gun DLC recently and the amount of people getting achievements in the expansion was like 05% that&#39;s 12th of 1% also yeah I do buy dlc&#39;s but if you&#39;re anything like me you&#39;re like Ah that&#39;s a good game I&#39;ll get around of that and then you don&#39;t you get distracted by something else and you forget about it or maybe you do the start of the DLC realize you&#39;re underleveled underprepared you start the game over and you lose interest because you just played the rest of the game over again to do better at the DLC and it was not something you really wanted to do but you did it for the DLC and then by the time you got to the DLC it&#39;s like ah this isn&#39;t worth it sometimes just starting the DLC is a pain you got to get halfway through the game complete this obscure side quest and it&#39;s already failed when you load up your save because you already got too far so you got to look up how to even start the damnn thing like in bloodborne with the only way to start the DLC was to get grabbed by an invisible hand at a random spot like there were people that complained about the Elden ring DLC starting point sorry try the bloodborne one and I&#39;m going to mention a different Quest from Witcher 3 now blood and wine just let you jump into the new stuff it&#39;s basically a separate game I mean they set your level at a certain point give you specific equipment but thing is if you want Siri to be Queen you&#39;re going to have to play the whole game over and then play the DLC but still you can play the DLC but I&#39;ll tell you this what&#39;s probably the worst is when you&#39;ve set a game aside cuz it&#39;s done and over with and you kind of lose your Edge forget how to play it a little bit then you buy the DLC and jump back into it and the game expects you to have uh been an expert all along and you feel like you have no idea what you&#39;re doing there&#39;s a lot of barriers that keep people from playing and completing single player DLC I can&#39;t blame someone for just giving up and not bothering and I think I&#39;ve just explained to you the entire reason why we never got any Grand Theft Auto 5 DLC let&#39;s like are people going to buy it if they&#39;re not really going to play it I would guess a lot of people might answer no but they will play Grand Theft Auto online got to get those Shark cards man sad but true and finally at number one the true secret ending what do you mean you didn&#39;t get the secret ending all you have to do is beat the game then complete this obscure side quest and go back to this hidden area and pick all the right dialogue options and don&#39;t forget to eat the umbilical cords while rejecting the giant wish granter that was a mouthful um most of the time getting the secret ending is is a huge pain in the ass it&#39;s just not worth the extra effort usually all you get for your trouble is seven extra seconds a cut scene taged on the end for a sequel hook that&#39;s never going to get followed up on anyway sure some games have secret endings that are pretty easy to Su out by today&#39;s sandard The Secret of Symphony of the Night is pretty you not secret but so many games have obscure nearly impossible to find hidden endings that no human being in their right Minds would ever discover them on their own without some kind of guide those are the ones most of us just don&#39;t bother with they force you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty with no Autos saving collect all the perfect speedrunning relics and uh you know stuff is theoretically possible for a human being to do but it&#39;s very hard for me too you know you got to press a button in the middle of a cut scene you didn&#39;t know about and that didn&#39;t happen anywhere else in the game so thanks for that secret endings can be some real BS and I don&#39;t blame anyone for ignoring them you beat the game once you got an ending that&#39;s basically what people want like finishing the game at all is an accomplishment just give me the trophy for that even if it&#39;s just a participation trophy let&#39;s wrap this thing up all right let&#39;s let&#39;s wrap it up I&#39;m not wrapping it up by the way I have a bonus for you maong otherwise known as a miname where 100% runs go to die some Yakuza games want you to get a high score in maong to finish them but I do not know how to play majang I&#39;ve learned how to play maong countless times I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t understand it it doesn&#39;t stay with me and this is where I draw the line I&#39;m not I&#39;m not going to do this I get the basic idea it&#39;s like poker You&#39;re Building hands I don&#39;t understand how the scoring Works might as well be theoretical physics I am not doing a doctoral thesis to get to the end of a of a yakas a game sorry I&#39;ll take any other obscure Japanese board game shogi more like easy Koi Koi CeeLo oi kabu all that stuff it&#39;s nothing maong it&#39;s impenetrable unless you are a Midwestern grandma and I am not I don&#39;t understand why they get it by the way why do they get it it&#39;s a hyp specific issue but there&#39;s so many yakaza games that they&#39;re basically a genre all to the VES and so many of these things come out a year uh that they can easily dominate the single player game time especially if you&#39;re one of those lunatics who want to 100% all of it at my advice do maong first cuz it&#39;s what separates the standard completionists from the degenerate psychos willing to put themselves through the torture of not just trying to win but understanding maong that&#39;s all I&#39;ve

      "subtitles": "(techno garble) - [Falcon] Welcome back to another episode of &quot;Before You Buy,&quot; the show where we give you\nsome straight up gameplay and our first impressions of\nthe latest games releasing. So when Final Fantasy XVI released back in June of last year, it kinda had a little\ncontroversy going in, but first impressions\nwere pretty positive, but as more people were able to sit down and play the game, opinions\ndid begin to sour a bit. It looked like a surefire bet\nthat ended up being another in a long line of contentious\nfinal fantasy games, but for entirely different\nreasons than usual. The thing about it is it is\nan actual finished product, feature complete, not a ton of bugs. Forget the fact that the PS5&#39;s recent firmware update broke the game. That&#39;s not their fault. That&#39;s on Sony. But it&#39;s not a half-finished mess like a lot of the recent\nfinal fantasy games outside of the Final Fantasy seven remakes, ah, they&#39;ve just been not great at launch. Its problems are different. It&#39;s not necessarily that obvious\nwhen you first boot it up, it&#39;s not a bad game, far from it. I actually really like it a lot, but longtime Final Fantasy fans are not getting exactly\nwhat they&#39;re expecting. It&#39;s pretty far removed from\nFinal Fantasy expectations. It&#39;s an action game. It&#39;s barely an RPG and that&#39;s something you&#39;re\njust gonna have to accept if you wanna enjoy this. I am okay with that. I like my hybrid Final\nFantasy VII remakes. I like that system, probably the most of any final fantasy battle\nsystem, and this is not that. It is an action game, full stop. You got one character you play as, they smack enemies with swords and that&#39;s mostly what\nyou&#39;re doing in this game. You watch cut scenes,\nit&#39;s excellent action and the cut scenes are really\nimpressive and well-acted. That&#39;s the game though. Looking back at it a year\nlater, it&#39;s a game that I like. I like it a lot. I am enjoying playing it again on the PC. We&#39;ll talk more about that\nin a second obviously, but after year, I can&#39;t acknowledge a lot of the things people don&#39;t like about it. It&#39;s one of those games\nwhere you need to know what you&#39;re getting into because with the right\nexpectations, there is a ton to like about it, but if you\nthink you&#39;re getting the JRPG version of which you&#39;re three or even like something closer to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,\nyou are at very least going to be confused if not disappointed. That sounds like I&#39;m\nsaying you should expect the game to suck. Absolutely not. It&#39;s just a really different\nkind of Final Fantasy game. But to be fair, it has\nbeen all over the map since Final Fantasy X\nthat was 20 years ago. But as much as there has\nbeen different systems in the game, it&#39;s also been\ndifferent levels of quality and I&#39;m happy to report this game is on the high end of that, like it&#39;s a high quality game. Opinions are divided. I&#39;m in the positive camp. There are some things that I struggle with in terms of my thoughts on the game, but they&#39;re not the PC port because I wanna say chef&#39;s\nkiss on this PC port. It is excellent. Right when you boot it up, it preloads the shader cache\nbefore the game even starts and you can change settings before you even get to the main menu. Every PC game should do this. Give us the option to adjust things before jumping to the game proper because let me tell you, it\nreally sucks every time you go into a game and it&#39;s just\nset on like whatever settings they want for the first 20 minutes. It&#39;s garbage and I hate it\nand there&#39;s none of that here. It is wonderful. The graphics menu has tons to work with. I&#39;ve got a good PC but\nfrom what I have seen, it seems like it runs pretty\nwell even on moderate machines. It&#39;s one of those games\nthat looks really nice and well rendered, but\nthey&#39;re not going hard on experimental graphics features. Game ran flawlessly on\nPC for me, which is yes. Honestly, when I played it on\nPlayStation five last year, my whole thing was I can&#39;t\nwait to play this on PC. I played obviously for a\nvery long period of time, but still, I couldn&#39;t\nwait to play it on PC. I&#39;ve talked about it on\nX/Twitter multiple times and it&#39;s just so impressive to see how smooth it runs even\ndespite how chaotic and flashy certain moments are. I&#39;ll also say this, it&#39;s\nimproved greatly from the demo. When I played the demo, I did notice some minor\nslowdown when the game would transition between\ngameplay and cinematics. In the actual game, I have experienced none of that. None of that despite the insane tornado of effects thrown at you at all times. Combat felt silky smooth,\nmassively responsive. Didn&#39;t experience any stuttering at all. Seriously, absolutely none. I can almost never say\nthat about PC games. It was starting to feel\nlike an unavoidable fact the last few months as games\nare just gonna stutter, but this one has none. Compared to the PS5 version, you can play it on higher resolutions, and That&#39;s the most noteworthy difference and the reason I&#39;ve wanted to replay it on PC this entire time. Everything is so crisp, so readable, it looks less\nwashed out, less murky. The game doesn&#39;t have like\nany vivid burst of color. It&#39;s generally still pretty muted when there aren&#39;t a ton of\neffects going on on screen, but I think that actually\nworks to its benefit because it makes the effects\nthat much more impressive. If you care what the PC\nversion is like, there you go. It&#39;s one of the better ports\nI&#39;ve played in a long time. It runs well. I&#39;ve experienced no major bugs. Couple of minor visual\nhiccups here and there like a little bit of\nflickering in the distance, maybe some blocky shadows here and there, but if I wasn&#39;t looking for\nit, I wouldn&#39;t have seen it. It&#39;s really minor stuff. In general, the game runs really well. It can look extremely good at times and the controls are very responsive. I even tested out the mouse and keyboard set up to\nsee what that felt like and it works. So many PC Porsches give up and say, &quot;Yeah, you use a controller.&quot; I mean, I used a controller\nfor the majority of my playing, but it&#39;s nice that they put the extra time giving PC players something usable. I didn&#39;t even feel the\nneed to rebind everything. I did do it with Dodge. It&#39;s set to control by default and I&#39;m gonna give myself\ncarpal tunnel syndrome with control as a default. I have a pretty decent\nwingspan, so to speak. I&#39;m a bird after all, but\nit doesn&#39;t really matter. It&#39;s more the angles than the distance, but that&#39;s the PC port. Excellent job, excellent job. It&#39;s not even full price. It&#39;s 50 bucks for the base version, 50. You know what games used to be full price, that&#39;s the full price\nfor the base of this game and oof, that&#39;s nice. You can pay $70 for the\nversion with all the DLC. I have played the DLC. If you like this game,\nit is 100% worth it. Some of the best bosses in\nthe game are in the DLC, so. But now that we&#39;ve gotten the\nPC port stuff out of the way, let&#39;s actually talk the\ngame, the base game, in fact. It&#39;s a game I overall\nlike, quite a bit actually. It is far from perfect,\nvery linear to a fault for the first five or six hours. That first hour, it&#39;s slow too. I feel like somebody said\nFinal fantasy VII is so great because you open in the\nmiddle of all the action and they were like, &quot;We\nshould open in all the action, but also we wanna say 100 things as the action is happening.&quot; And woo does it slow it down because technically,\nthey open in the middle of all the action, but you\nreally don&#39;t play for a while and the first bit of\nplaying isn&#39;t even fighting. It&#39;s jumping through a canyon. My harshest criticisms for the game are actually the opening. Once it gets going, I like it way more. I will say once the game opens up, it doesn&#39;t add a whole lot to it. It&#39;s still kinda really great\nfighting and cut scenes, but I mean, I&#39;m fine with that. The quote unquote &quot;open\nmaps,&quot; they&#39;re pretty small for a game like this and there&#39;s\nnot really a lot of them. Towns are fairly small and mostly empty, save for some MPCs who unload a lot of pretty standard side\nquests on your shoulders. These are pretty old school\nthings as far as JRPGs go and I actually contribute to\nthe game feeling like a JRPG and even though it really isn&#39;t, when I said it&#39;s barely a JRPG, I don&#39;t know if I even mean\nthat like it&#39;s an action game with, you know, stuff that makes it kind of feel like a JRPG. This is that. You&#39;re doing basic stuff like clearing out monsters\nor collecting resources. Pretty rare that a side quest does anything particularly exciting. They do give the world some flavor and expand some of the lore occasionally, but I mean that&#39;s the exception. It&#39;s side quests. They&#39;re dull in most games except for the monster hunts in most games and they are a highlight\nin this game as well. The combat system is the\nbest part of this game. The boss fights are the\nbest parts of the combat, so it works. I&#39;m not gonna say the\ncombat has no drawbacks. It does have them. It feels incredibly good. It&#39;s deliberate, but still very fast paced and it&#39;s intense without\nbeing overwhelming, but it takes a while to get going. The game has training\nwheels on for a long time and combat can start to feel\na bit tedious and repetitive. There&#39;s like a ton of it. It&#39;s mostly everything you&#39;re doing. It does trend towards the tails end of the spectrum of RPG combat. Certain enemies and bosses are just like massive chunks of HP. You gotta slowly grind down. Certain fights are gonna\ndrag on for quite a while. That&#39;s not a bad thing if you like it, but if you find constantly\nwailing on a boss for a long time to do damage and if\nyou find that annoying, you&#39;re gonna probably be\nfrustrated with this game. Sometimes it&#39;s not always like that, but if you fights feel like\nthey drag on a little longer than necessary, even if\nthey are well designed. The story has proven to be\npretty divisive with people too. There are some strong characters. Our me man, Clive seems like\nyour generic anime protagonist with a chip on his shoulders, but the voice acting really carries him. Cid is awesome. One of the best interpretations\nof that character for sure. When the story starts out, it seems like it&#39;s gonna be\nthis &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; epic with shifting alliances\nand complex politics and I guess it&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t know, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; kind of soured me on &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot; but they kinda clear the\nboard about halfway through. Again, this is kind of both good and bad. You got a complex political\nmap that&#39;s mostly cleared around the halfway point of the game and it becomes Final Fantasy&#39;s\nversion of Attack on Titan with much less of the wild swings that Attack on Titan takes. The story does manage to be a little safe and familiar past the opening\nhours, which like I said, are a bit slow, but they tease this more Final Fantasy tactics like tone, but the game doesn&#39;t really stick with it. Instead of a complicated\nplot, it leans on spectacle, but it does that really well. Like Final Fantasy XVI\nhas some of the craziest, most over-the-top nuts\nboss fights I&#39;ve ever seen, and they somehow keep\ntopping themselves up to the mind-boggling finale. These giant monster throw\ndowns, they are an experience. And they&#39;re more interactive and fun to play than\nyou might think at first because you retain the same control scheme as a standard fight but at the end of the\nday, it is pure spectacle. They&#39;re not designed to\nbe super challenging, so the quote unquote &quot;real boss&quot; of a chapter is usually\nfought before these things. It has the odd effect of\nmaking the biggest, baddest, most climactic bosses, the\neasiest ones in the game because this game can\nbe quite challenging. Some of the fights are\nlegitimately tense and difficult, but the icon battles aren&#39;t. That&#39;s by design. They&#39;re cinematic, they&#39;re climactic, and if you made that too difficult, it would be very annoying. But I gotta say it is weird\nhow well they work out. They work great. They are highlights of the\ngame on a technical level, the artistry, the graphical\nfidelity on screen and hey, the characters look great pretty much throughout the entire game. The cut scenes are all lavishly presented. Also, certain areas\nlook absolutely amazing like the Great Wood or the rare moments where you actually get to go\ninto one of the capital cities, but a lot of the game is\nspent in kinda dull castles and rundown little towns. They don&#39;t have a lot going on, they look fine, but like it doesn&#39;t matter how good you render them. It&#39;s not like Final Fantasy VII where towns all kind of have a theme. These are more like medieval towns as they were, to some extent, at least. There are some straight up\ndrab locations in the game and they get worse the second half because the world starts to\nbecome more post-apocalyptic and everything is blanketed\nand a purple gray haze. It&#39;s not a flattering look for the game and hopefully some\nenterprising model will come in and restore some color\nbecause it makes everything muddier and harder to see. It generally makes the game look worse. It&#39;s the one choice that I just flat out\ndon&#39;t like about the game and that&#39;s Final Fantasy XVI. It&#39;s a game with a lot of cool stuff, but also some problems. On principle, some people\nare just never gonna like it, but for me personally,\nI&#39;m just happy to see that SQUARE ENIX is capable of putting out a funnel fantasy\ngame with a clear vision. It&#39;s not a mess. The PC port is great. You might call it unambitious or safe with its gameplay systems, but in many ways, it feels\nlike an RPG from the PS3 era updated for the current gen, and I find that to be charmingly simple and honestly, refreshingly\nstraightforward. I&#39;m also gonna say it&#39;s\nrefreshing to play a combat system that isn&#39;t completely\nderived from a souls borne, but it&#39;s also very derived\nfrom Platinum Games who had some input on this game. It also happens to be kind\nof my favorite type of combat and I would really like it if there was more of that in games. I kinda like that Black Myth Wukong is somewhere between the middle of them, but I also really like games\nwith this kind of combat. It&#39;s not quite band that obviously, but for a nice long epic\nwith some pretty good combat and it works. I really enjoyed my revisit\nto this world, flaws and all. If you both understand and embrace what this\ngame is trying to be, I think hell of a purchase at 50 bucks. Actually, you know, hell of a purchase at 70 bucks with the DLC. That&#39;s what I think.

Here are some of our favorites.\nSubscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/gameranxTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#EldenRing\n\n10. Spirit-caller Snail - ROAD'S END CATACOMBS, found in eastern Liurnia south of the minor Erdtree\n\n9. Starscourge Radahn - found in Redmane Castle, in the Southern part of Caelid\n\n8. Godskin Apostle - Dominula, Windmill Village which is on the northern edge of the Altus Region\n\n7. Patches - found in Murkwater cave in the center of Limgrave, look for a cave entrance in the ravine filled with skeletons\n\n6. Mimic Tear - found in Nokron, which can only be accessed after defeating Starscourge Radahn and going down the giant hole in Limgrave formed by his comet, which is in South of Mistwood\n\n5. Wormface - the guardian of the Minor Erdtree at the center of Altus in the forest area\n\n4. Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella - Found by exploring the ainsel river region, which can be accessed in the Liurnia region from the Ainsel River Well north of the Liurnia Divine tower\n\n3. Ancestor Spirit - found by lighting the fires at all of the monuments in the Siofra River area then going to Hallowhorn hall and interacting with the corpse. The area can be accessed from the Siofra River Well, which is found near the Minor Erdtree in Limgrave, in the mistwood forest.\n\n2. Ryckard - Found in the Volcano Manor at the top of Mt. Gelmir, which is in the western part of Atlus. Can only be accessed if you agree to help Lady Tanith and complete the questline there, a secret door can be found in the first room to the right after you've made enough progress with the quest. Kill the people she wants you to kill and talk to everyone and it should unlock.\n\n1. Astel - Found in the River of Rot, an area that can only be accessed by making a certain amount of progress in Ranni's Questline, which is too complicated to explain here - \nhttps://gameranx.com/features/id/290315/article/elden-ring-how-to-enter-the-lake-of-rot-secret-area-guide/\n\nBONUS \n\nMalenia - Found in Miquella's Haligtree, a location that can only be reached by finding 2 parts of the Haligtree Secret Medallion. 1 is found in Castle Sol in the Mountaintop of the Giants and one is in the Village of the Albinaurics, a town build under a mountain to the west in Liurnia. There's a villager disguised as a pot hiding there: attack them to reveal the ruse and talk to them to get 1 half of the haligtree secret medallion. When you have both you get an alternate option at the Grand Lift of Rold that takes you to the Consecrated Snowfield and eventually the Haligtree.",
