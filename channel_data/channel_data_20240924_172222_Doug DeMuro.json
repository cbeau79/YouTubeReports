      "subtitles": "this is the new 2024 Subaru cross Trek Wilderness which is a new off-road Adventure version of the Subaru cross Trek which is itself an off-road Adventure version of the Subaru Impreza today I&#39;m going to review the new cross Trek Wilderness and show you all of its quirks and [Applause] features today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website for modern Enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has hosted more than 20,000 car auctions of special cool and interesting cars like this and this and this and this so if you&#39;re looking to buy or sell an Enthusiast car do it on cars and bids all right time for the quirks and features of the cross track Wilderness and I&#39;m going to start with the basics so brand new model based on the brand new Subaru Impreza the Impreza is fully redesigned for 2024 and this car comes out with it now the Wilderness is an offroy adventure version of the Subaru cross Trek which like I said is already an off-road Adventure version of the standard Subaru empreza and speaking of the new Impreza one interesting thing for the the 24 model year the new redesign there is no more sedan version being offered the empreza is now only available as a hatchback you can still get the WRX as a sedan only but there will be no more Impreza sedan of course also true of the Cross Trek and the Wilderness now under the hood the new Impreza is offered with two available engine choices there&#39;s a 2 L flat 4 with about 150 horsepower or you can upgrade to a 2.5 l flat 4 with about 180 horsepower in the wilderness only that larger more powerful engine is standard you don&#39;t have to worry about the base level stuff now also on the subject of Powertrain manual transmission is gone from the cross Trek for the new 2024 model automatic only this year and the Wilderness has one big upgrade here in addition to more standard power extra towing capacity a cross Trek can tow about 1,500 lb but the Wilderness boosts that to 3500 lb thanks to some additional cooling which allows you to pull more stuff and fits in with its Wilderness Adventure theme and the cross Trek Wilderness gets a lot more upgrades than just that let&#39;s start with off-road capability so the regular empreza has 5.1 Ines of ground clearance the cross Trek is significantly lifted about 8.7 in the Wilderness has an even bigger lift another 6 in of ground clearance on top of the Cross Treck so a lifted version of a lifted version of a hatchback the result is that this has more ground clearance than a Ford bronos Sport Badlands or a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk which are undoubtedly the most off-road focused compact crossovers even though this is merely a lifted hatchback it beats out those and with the lift and some styling changes comes better approach angle better departure angle and better off-road breakover angle as well plus there are other off-road capability upgrades like a skin plate in front to protect important components under the car and the Wilderness comes standard with these Yokohama geolander allterrain tires which obviously improves capability even further getting off the pavement and if you like to go explore the well the wilderness you also have another great benefit in the wilderness which is the roof rack that can carry up to 700 lbs which means you can set up a rooftop tent and then camp on the roof of your Wilderness if you so desire and there are some other less important but still notable changes that help improve the Wilderness capability off the pavement like fog lights which comes standard on the Wilderness model as you can see LED fogs and this giant hood decal which Subaru says is anti-glare if you&#39;re somewhere off-roading sun is beating right down this will help minimize the glare a little bit which does help you also have plastic a lot of plastic the front bumper and Grill of transformed into this large unpainted plastic piece as you can see same deal in the back the rear bumper this large plastic piece different from a painted bumper you&#39;d see on most vehicles and then on the sides you have significantly more plastic cladding above the wheels by The Doors there is plastic all throughout the exterior of this car now the plastic has two functions number one because it&#39;s unpainted kind of basic plastic it&#39;s more scratch resistant than painted surfaces you&#39;re off-roading tree branches rocks hit your stuff you don&#39;t have to go repaint something because you have all this plastic number two function of the plastic is to make the car uglier there&#39;s no doubt that it is a little weird looking with all of this excess plastic on the outside it&#39;s certainly a bit opinion splitting a little polarizing but regardless of your thoughts this is what silaru has done to create the Wilderness they&#39;ve given it lots of exterior plastic and there are some other exterior changes too that are well frankly purely cosmetic one is the copper accents throughout the exterior up in the front you can see a little copper accents near the plastic bumpers also on the roof racks you got these copper accents near the front and on the side it says cross track and this car is distinctive copper color and in the back you also have additional copper accenting I guess this is to help distinguish the Wilderness from the standard cross track make it stand out a little more give it sort of a special theme and board notable cosmetic upgrades for one black wheels all of the Wilderness models come with them that&#39;s the latest Trend and the Wilderness is jumping on board you also have Subaru printed in massive letters on the rear bumper as I&#39;m sure you saw before just to make sure everybody knows this is a Subaru in addition to that rather large badge there&#39;s other large badging throughout this car Wilderness badges that are pretty big and pretty pronounced on the back and on the sides just to let everybody know this is not your standard cross Trek no no this is the Wilderness and next we move inside the Wilderness e cross Trek Wilderness where there are more Wilderness upgrades like for example the seats which you can see are this kind of odd material it&#39;s called starch and it&#39;s this synthetic sort of faux leather that makes them more water resistant so when you&#39;re out there in the wilderness doing Wilderness things you can Wilderness the Wilderness you can you can clean off the seats easier if they get muddy or dirt dirty you also have rubber floor mats as you can see with this cool kind of off-road tire tread design which does improve your capabilities you can go off the pavement and not worry about getting your floor mats dirty or muddy since cleaning them is easy then by the way those floor mats are not just for the foot Wells below the seats you also have a rubber floor mat in the cargo area as you can see here a huge rubber Wilderness floor matat to make it easy to hose down with a cool design on it just like the ones in the foot Wells and you have cargo area cup holders in the wilderness Subaru tells me this is distinctive to the Wilderness you don&#39;t get it in the standard cross Trek so if you want to carry drinks in your cargo area you must upgrade to a Wilderness also worth pointing out that obviously all cross trck models all Impreza models come standard with all-wheel drive but if you get a cross Trek you get the X mode drive mode system which includes various different configurable Drive modes based on the terrain you&#39;re on this is not unique to the Wilderness it&#39;s on all cross Trek models but still worth pointing out since it&#39;s on the Wilderness 2 and there are some cosmetic touches inside the Wilderness to distinguish it from a standard impressor for example you get gold stitching on the seats intended to match those copper gold accents on the outside bring some of that color in here and that same copper is on the base of the steering wheel begin to reinforce the wilderness copper colored theme and imprinted into the headrest you have the Subaru Wilderness logo which looks kind of cool and again adds a little bit of flare and character to the Wilderness by the way it&#39;s also worth pointing out a couple of cool Mountain images hidden inside this car one on the rear door sill kind of going up the side you won&#39;t really notice it that often but it&#39;s there you also have one on the rear scratch plate in the cargo area this mountain image going across that includes a graphic of a cross Trek driving through the mountains which is kind of cute and you also have Mountain Imaging in the base of the cup holders here up front you can see a little mountain Graphics although this mountain section is removable you can just pull this out if you don&#39;t like mountains you don&#39;t have to you don&#39;t have to see them in your cup holders just take them away so those are all the Wilderness upgrades compared to the Cross Trek and the standard and Pres and you might be wondering what this costs the answer is it starts around $33,000 including shipping now an Impreza starts around 24,000 and a cross Trek starts around 26,000 this has a lot of additional upgrades over the cross Trek although it is a fairly substantial price pump to get the Wilderness and so it&#39;ll probably only go to the most wilderness of enthusiasts but beyond all the Wilderness stuff let&#39;s talk through the rest of the crks and features in this car starting in the obvious place the infotainment system which is the big news for the redesigned 2024 Impreza giant vertical infotainment screen huge captivates the entire center of the dashboard and it really is impressive for a car like this a compact car compact crossover in this case to have a screen this big almost Tesla like in terms of size so let&#39;s go through it along the top row of this infotainment screen you have a configurable little screen that shows a few different available pie of information you have some vehicle info up here you have the weather if you want it you have your current drive mode with that X mode all-wheel drive system and you have your Bluetooth all visible on this little screen now the rest of the screen is of course available for all of the rest of the functions vehicle settings Bluetooth music all the stuff You&#39; need an infotainment screen for and that unfortunately includes climate controls which are on the bottom yes the climate controls are now integrated into this giant infotainment screen but it&#39;s worth pointing out that Subaru has kept a few of the most important controls as physical buttons specifically the temperature control driver and passenger side you can still razor lower the climate control temperature with physical buttons and rear window defroster front window defogger are still physical buttons as well you don&#39;t have to go into the menu for those but the rest of the stuff is at the bottom of the screen thankfully fixed in place but still there also worth pointing out by the way Subaru has kept a couple of other things as physical buttons the volume knob here as you can see and the tuner knob over on the other side speaking of physical buttons by the way one other climate function that isn&#39;t integrated into the screen your heated seats which are mounted here in the center console this high low rocker switch that Subaru has been using for heated seat controls since the dawn of time they&#39;re still using this very same switch today and it hasn&#39;t migrated into the screen now in terms of this screen I will say I do have one disappointment which is the camera situation in this car you only have a backup camera as you can see it&#39;s here the quality is pretty good but that&#39;s it Subaru Prides itself on safety it&#39;s eyesight system that can stop the car featured in a lot of vehicles and very useful it would be nice to get a top down camera system or more camera technology in this car which would add to the safety and it would help take full advantage of this giant screen a great 360 camera here would be wonderful to see but sadly we don&#39;t have it but anyway next up moving beyond the screen a few other interesting quirks and features one is charging where you have basically all types you can see usba a and USB C Chargers here in the center control stack below that you have a wireless charging pad for your devices and in the center console you have a traditional 12vt cigarette lighter style Outlet on to the steering wheel wheel which is well frankly pretty self-explanatory nothing too unusual or special here except you have buttons marked s and I you might be wondering what that is it&#39;s basically a sport mode and an eco mode s of course being Sport and I is supposed to stand for intelligent but really it functions as a bit of an eco mode and tries to slow down responses a little bit to save you some fuel as for the gauge cluster behind the steering wheel it&#39;s fairly simple in keeping with the theme of most Subaru cars simple durable that&#39;s true here no gauge cluster screen yet you have traditional old school analog gauges with a smaller screen in the middle now nothing too special about that Center smaller screen although I do love the fact that it shows you the cumulative fuel that you have saved in start stop mode shutting off the car a lot of enthusiasts hate this turns the car off at stop lights can be kind of annoying well here it actually gives you a breakdown of how much fuel you&#39;ve saved gives you the benefit of start stop mode which is neat to see and next up we move on to the back seats in the wilderness which are well fairly basic there&#39;s not too much interesting stuff back here although you still get the same water resistant seating material that you had up front and you have the same gold stitching to again tie in the wilderness special copper gold color even to the back seats and you get a surprisingly roomy back seat which really does shock me I don&#39;t think of this as a very big car as aable car but I&#39;m sitting back here a very tall adult my head still has a couple inches from the roof my knees are up against the front but it&#39;s positioned where I would sit as a tall person and frankly it&#39;s got decent space not as much room as a Honda CRV or Toyota Rav 4 but not that much less and I think if you wanted to use this as a family car especially with a young family and smaller children rear seat room shouldn&#39;t be the reason that you would say no it does have a big enough back seat it&#39;s pretty good now other than that again really not much going on back here you do have charge ports usba and USBC in the center but they take the place of any sort of rear seat climate vent which some other cars do have in this segment and there&#39;s no storage pocket situation down here you just have those Chargers which is fine now in the center armrest you put that down and you have a couple of cup holders which is also fine and they supplement the ones that you already have inside your door pocket other than that nothing too crooky or interesting in the back seat of the Wilderness and finally we move on to the cargo area of the Wilderness you pop open the tailgate not power operated by the way and you get well the cargo area which is nothing particularly special I already showed you the mountain design on the scratch PL the rubber floor mat of course you also have a cargo cover it&#39;s not particularly large back here compared to the Rav 4 and the CRV it also feels smaller back here just like it did in the back seat now that&#39;s an intentional choice for some people who choose this car just because it&#39;s smaller and has a smaller footprint than those SUVs but just so you know the cross trck and the Wilderness don&#39;t necessarily have as much space in back as some of their SUV Rivals all right driving the cross trk Wilderness first thing I want to say uh before I get to the Driving Experience since I&#39;ve had this press car for the last few days I&#39;ve been noticing other cross trcks around wow there are a lot of them it is amazing to me how popular this vehicle has become and it&#39;s kind of a blend in don&#39;t really notice don&#39;t really care type of car for enthusiasts and so you don&#39;t really realize it but they are everywhere even in Southern California where no one has needed all-wheel drive for anything ever it&#39;s just a lifestyle A vibe people want it and boy is it doing well it reminds me of growing up in Denver when the Outback was first coming out back in the mid late 90s and how often you&#39;d see them that&#39;s the Tre now but let&#39;s talk Driving Experience and I got to say for what this vehicle is I think the Driving Experience is pretty excellent and I I give that for what this vehicle is caveat because this is not a luxury car it&#39;s not intended to be a performance car and once you get those two things out of the way then you can start appreciating this car for what it is you do hear some noise some road noise some wind noise um not bad not egregious even on the highway I&#39;m not hearing a lot of Tire I&#39;m not hearing a lot of the cars going by but it&#39;s also not a Mercedes S-Class where you&#39;re totally insulated from the outside environment you hear some stuff as you&#39;d expect in a car that&#39;s about at this price point the materials inside are about the same the stuff that you feel the stuff that you touch I kind of touched on it earlier and showed you but just driving it around you get that feeling reinforced it&#39;s very nice it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine for what it is but again not a high-end opulent luxury car or anything of the sort you&#39;re getting kind of a utilitarian vehicle and that&#39;s that and the same goes for performance Subaru has over the years added more power to the Cross trk which has always been a drawback of this car in the past but even now even with the latest power boost this is not a fast car it is a usable car you can accelerate up highway on ramps and and pass people and such but it&#39;s not fast you&#39;re not going to get Thrills out of this car your Thrills are going to come from taking it into the Wilderness and seeing all the cool I don&#39;t know big horn sheep from the Comforts of your Subaru it will not come from from the fun of driving this car but you get past those things and what you are left with is just a good car a good utilitarian drivable car you feel sturdy you feel reliable you feel relatively tough it is just a nice car and I have to say the steering is nice and communicative quicker than I expect you know everybody talks about how quick like the Mazda CX-5 steering is to me this feels better than that kind of owing to Subaru&#39;s Heritage as a as a fun car manufacturer as well and just overall it&#39;s a nice car it drives well it&#39;s good and you compare it to there&#39;s a cross trk you compare it to like a Honda CRV there&#39;s a cross trk you know Toyota Rav 4 you can see why people under are starting to like these cars not starting to I mean they&#39;re already popular but they&#39;re they offer a little bit of ground clearance but you don&#39;t necessarily have the height or the size of a vehicle like a Rav 4 a CRV there&#39;s a cross Trek and it works it it drives well there&#39;s a cross Trek I&#39;m serious it drives well and it&#39;s like a nice usable drivable vehicle like a lot of Subarus it doesn&#39;t overd deliver except in the way that it just feels like good good usable totally reasonable car that you kind of get the feeling you could get a lot of miles out of but I must say driving around I&#39;ve had this feeling like oh I blend in so much compared to the stupid cars I drive that attract so much attention this car is is is good for its almost just like daily usability without any sort of BS at all and now the benefit of the this cross Trek is there&#39;s a cross Trek you can take it Offroad and you can really actually go somewhere with it in the past the cross Trek has been a nice lifted impr present it&#39;s had a few capabilities but now it has like legitimate crossover competing capabilities where you can do some stuff with it and actually really go places and in and tow a little bit but enough for most people and frankly that makes this car a exact there&#39;s a cross Trek that makes this car exactly what most people are looking for and I think it it&#39;s it&#39;s really a home run in terms of like value for the money use it ability you just you can&#39;t there&#39;s a cross Trek you can&#39;t want something like really really insane and special because that&#39;s not what it is and so that&#39;s the new 2024 Subaru cross Trek Wilderness a little hatchback that became a taller hatchback that became a off-roader almost SUV it&#39;s a little weird looking but there&#39;s a lot to like here and now it&#39;s time to give the new cross Trek Wilderness a Doug score and the cross Trek Wilderness ends up here 47 out of 100 which puts it here against Rivals and some other relevant cars it&#39;s in the middle of the pack and I think that&#39;s okay the cross Trek Wilderness is a bit pricey for what it is in a way that would appeal to most people but it&#39;s supposed to be sort of a niche product specifically aimed at off- rotor types who are willing to spend more to get more capability real competition comes from the Ford bronos Sport which has a lower base price more power more equipment similar capabilities and the all important Bron name but the Wilderness holds its own as a competitive rival [Applause] [Music]"

      "subtitles": "this is Doug deuro and I have just returned from driving my Toyota seoa all the way across the country from California to Massachusetts twice actually and back 6400 miles total and it didn&#39;t go so well let&#39;s [Applause] discuss today&#39;s video is sponsored by cars and bids which is my online car auction website site for modern Enthusiast cars so far cars and bids has sold almost $500 million worth of cars all sorts of special and cool stuff like this and this and this and this if you&#39;re looking to sell your Enthusiast car reach a vast audience at carsand bids.com okay so a couple months ago I came to you and told you my first impressions of my Toyota seoa because I had driven it from California to Massachusetts in a frankly uneventful CrossCountry road trip it was great it was fine everything was good and I had some things I liked about the seoa like its driver assist features and its technology and its engine and I had some things I didn&#39;t like like the camo fender flares and some other stuff but mostly the camo fender flares well the drive from California to Massachusetts was uneventful like I said but the drive back there were a couple of shall we say issues that I think need to be discussed and we&#39;re going to start with the biggest issue which was a flat tire although I posted a picture of the flat tire on my Instagram page and about 4 million people responded and said that&#39;s not a flat tire your tire is obliterated which it was that&#39;s true uh you can see the picture here of the flat tire so let me tell you what happened I was driving along on Interstate 81 in East Tennessee and I noticed the car I I had the driver assist on so it was steering for me it was accelerating it was keeping it speed the cruise control and I noticed the the back of the car started to to sway a little bit um and this isn&#39;t all together surprising because the Lan keep assist can sometimes be a little wonky like sometimes it doesn&#39;t pick up on the lane lines and so sometimes it&#39;ll kind of sway you a little bit over in One Direction and so I didn&#39;t really not think anything of it uh but it started to sway a little bit more this is over the span of maybe 8 10 seconds and then I it was kind of really swaying and I looked down again 10 seconds and my tire pressure light was on uh and I knew exactly what had happened so um first thing I did uh was in the gauge cluster of the new Sequoia you can actually scroll over uh and and get individual tire pressure readings and while you&#39;re driving and and and so I IM immediately did that I knew how to do that I knew how to find it I went over and I found it in two seconds and it showed me that the back passenger SES the back right tire had zero PSI um um and that was pretty clear to me that was pretty clear what was going on because of the way the vehicle was behaving it clearly wasn&#39;t a slow leak that was just getting a little bit worse like it had happened and it was going flat right then and there now I&#39;m on the interstate thankfully it was in the middle of the day uh and I&#39;ve got my dog with me Noodle and the car is full like completely packed full of stuff absolutely every inch of the cargo area and then half of the rear seat noodle had half the seat and and the stuff was the other half and so that&#39;s not an ideal situation I&#39;m trying to get from Massachusetts California I have hotel reservations booked I have things I have to do when I get home that&#39;s already scheduled I really kind of need to get where I&#39;m going when I need to go there and so a flat tire was actually a a pretty big deal on a trip like this because initially immediately my mind starts thinking okay where in rural East Tennessee am I going to get a new Falcon wild Peak allterrain Tire matching the size of this car because I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be something I could patch or fix easily based on the way the car was going to all these thoughts went through my mind truly in 10 seconds I&#39;m like the trip is ruined like I&#39;m screwed so I realized it&#39;s the back right tire the car is full of stuff I pull over to the side of the highway now I personally hate stopping on the side of the freeway I think it&#39;s one of the most dangerous things that you can do in the car uh there&#39;s all sorts of videos online about cars you know parked on their shoulder the freeway getting hit by cars going 80 miles an hour and I mean stuff is just obliterated and my dog&#39;s in the back he doesn&#39;t I mean he would go flying even if I&#39;m trying to change a tire on the side of the freeway and I&#39;m not in the car people get hit that way they get killed all the time very scary I don&#39;t like to be in that situation so I pulled over to the side of the freeway just to see what was going on um you know is the tire is the wheel off the car like what what has happened I get out I look and the tire has has blown out that&#39;s a surprise you don&#39;t see a lot of new tires blow out and this is a new tire you know I bought the car in March of this year so it was a six-month-old car uh the date code on the tire was like December of the previous year so the tire is December of 23 the tire is not even a year old the car doesn&#39;t even at this point have 6,000 Mi on it so the tire doesn&#39;t have 6,000 Mi it&#39;s rare to see a tire blowout given that it&#39;s like a new tire in good condition on a modern car and a modern tire but I don&#39;t have a lot of time to think about what happened and whether the tire was faulted I don&#39;t really care about that right now I&#39;m sitting on the side of the freeway in East Tennessee and I got to figure out what to do so I look for the next exit and on my GPS the next exit isn&#39;t showing for 5 miles and the tire is blown out I mean I&#39;m not driving on this thing I I could drive it to the exit 5 miles away but I would probably destroy the wheel the tire would disintegrate as I drive and the wheel would would be hurt uh and I was thinking about doing that I was thinking you know a wheel for this car is expense proba 800 bucks but you know my life you kind of balancing maybe I&#39;ll drive but then I realized that on the other side of the freeway there&#39;s actually an exit directly behind me going the other direction it was only for the eastbound travel and not for me I guess the Northbound travel and not for me and so I did the craziest thing that I could imagine but I really wanted to get off the freeway and in it just so happened that right in the center of the the freeway lanes there was an emergency vehicle turnaround and so I I put the car in four-wheel drive because those are gravel and I only had one rear wheel I put the car in four-wheel drive and after a big break in some freeway traffic I turned into the emergency Lane the emergency turnaround and then I waited for a while for a break in the other direction traffic turned onto the shoulder and then I drove a half mile up the road uh and got off at the exit now me I had already solved half of the problem because my biggest fear was not getting atire changed it was getting killed so I&#39;m already off the freeway I&#39;m thinking okay great that alone is like a really better situation now that I&#39;m off the freeway I&#39;m on an exit ramp um I I can really think through this with a clear head and figure out what&#39;s going on at this point by the way I&#39;m I&#39;m 2300 miles from home and I&#39;m a, miles from where I had left I&#39;m I&#39;m really not anywhere for me but the good news is uh I had had this flat right in a town a city actually Kingsport Tennessee which is not a small City uh and so I I the first thing I did was I called AAA because I know that I have AAA coverage and I know that it&#39;s going to take them a while to get there and I figure I might as well call them I can probably change this myself but I might as well call them get them started cuz I&#39;ve seen it take an hour two hours sometime for AAA so that I might as well get it started so I called AAA and it was actually very easy this was like a text based thing they dispatch a guy and I said all right I have no idea when this guy&#39;s going to show up I&#39;m going to start the process now the big problem with the flat tire is that the back of the car is full of stuff and although the spare tire in a sequoia is mounted underneath the car the uh tools are actually mounted within the cargo area so I have to unpack a lot of the back of the car in order to get the little panels out on the side of the cargo area to get the Jack uh and the tire changing tools the the tire iron Etc but I do it and it takes me about eight minutes but I do it and in the meantime the car&#39;s got to stay on and running to keep the air cool because the dog&#39;s inside get the Jack and the tire tools out and then uh loosen the lug nuts and I start the process of getting the spare tire lowered from below below the car onto the onto the ground which is quite a process in a Toyota there&#39;s a tool you have to build you have to stick it into a little a little hole and just kind of twist you can&#39;t really see anything you&#39;re using your phone flashlight and hoping for the best anyway get the tire on the ground get it off the car and then the AAA guy shows up I mean 10 minutes after I&#39;d call it and I know how to change the tire I have no problem changing the tire on this car but the AAA guy is like a cheek cat he shows up with a floor jack an impact driver and an air compressor built into his van he&#39;s got the tire changed in 2 minutes now the benefit of this whole thing was um fulls siiz spare fulls siiz uh spare tire fulls sizee spare wheel and so I&#39;m thinking okay uh you know I&#39;m I got a full spare tire in this car I&#39;m trying to get to Memphis tonight it&#39;s like six more hours from where I broke down I&#39;m going to just try it and so I drove and I made it to Memphis on the spare tire and in fact I made it all the way home on the spare tire which was about 2,200 miles on the spare alone uh it&#39;s not really ideal for a couple reasons number one I don&#39;t have another spare so if I have another flat tire I&#39;m screwed number two uh once you put the spare tire on the tire pressure monitoring system is no longer activated because the spare doesn&#39;t have a TPMS sensor and so at that point the entire TPMS is fault and it says drive to dealer it won&#39;t show me any of the tire pressures not just the spare but any of them so I&#39;m driving without a spare and without tire pressure monitor not the best situation but I did drive a Lotus Elise across the country in 2012 it has none of those things figured I&#39;d be okay and so I drove to Memphis that night and I drove the next state of Albuquerque and the next state of San Diego made it home on the spare tire in fact the spare tire is still in the car and I&#39;m really glad I didn&#39;t need to order a tire because I went to my shop here in San Diego that I deal with for tires and such and and they ordered it said it be three days and so I can only imagine if I had had the blowout and then had to wait for a tire at at NE spare I&#39;d be sitting in Kingsport Tennessee right now still waiting for a tire to get on the car so that worked um and honestly the tall tire change process it it would have taken me probably about an hour to do it jacking it up it was really hot jacking up getting the whole thing done the guy came with the floor jack Etc got it done in 10 minutes the whole process I lost maybe 45 minutes on the road I got into Memphis really late that night but I got into the hotel I had planned and kept the same schedule but that wasn&#39;t the only problem believe it or not um somewhere in north Texas on Interstate 40 maybe Western Oklahoma uh the tow hitch cover fell off gone I went to get gas at the next stop it wasn&#39;t there anymore I don&#39;t like to litter but I didn&#39;t know what had happened and and I I posted this and a bunch of people in my comments told me that this is a common issue with the seoa these are falling off and there&#39;s a service Bolton about it so I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m going to bother replacing and I suspect the next one will also fall off and that&#39;s just that when I was about 5 hours from home in Arizona after drive it&#39;s a it&#39;s a three-day Drive uh a rock came up and hit my windshield and started a crack and I think the crack&#39;s going to get worse um that&#39;s a shame I wish it hadn&#39;t happened but it did uh and I to top all of this off uh when I was on my trip during the trip at 5,000 Mi the maintenance required light came on it was a time based thing it wasn&#39;t because it actually needed any had any problems but the light came on and so I&#39;ve been driving around for the last now it&#39;s at 8,500 mil for the last 3,000 Mi with the maintenance required light and I looked up what the maintenance is at 5,000 Mi and it turns out they check the fluids and rotate the tires and check the floor mat positioning and that&#39;s the stupidest service I&#39;ve ever heard of my entire life and I got to tell you that&#39;s a total waste of everybody&#39;s time I guess Toyota makes you do it because they they want to make sure it&#39;s in good shape and they want to get you out of 100 bucks or whatever they charge for a tire rotation but I&#39;m like that is just really a waste of time I there&#39;s no fluids exchanged there&#39;s they basically just check stuff and move the tires around and by the way I did I moved the tires around myself on the side of the road so I&#39;m thinking all right well I&#39;m I&#39;m going to skip this service but the drawback of skipping that service is the maintenance required light is then on for the next however want and there&#39;s still one more issue which is that when I bought the car Toyota only gives you one key when you buy a new uh vehicle because of the chip shortage or whatever and after 6 months or so you&#39;re allowed to order a second key well apparently I&#39;ve hit the span where I can order the second key uh so I have to get that done too so right now the status of myoy is the towed covers off the windshield&#39;s broken the spare tire is on the normal tire is shattered the wheel is probably okay but who knows uh the the windshield cracked and I only have one key the car is a little bit be leaguered uh it&#39;s it&#39;s had a tough time so I&#39;m going to get all that stuff taken care of actually it&#39;s not that big of a deal tire shop is going to put a new tire on put the spare back under the car Toyota dealer is going to order me a new key and do the next service which is an oil change um and that&#39;ll be fine and the windshield is just annoying I&#39;m going to hope the crack doesn&#39;t continue but it probably will I have to say as as as annoying as some of that stuff was uh the the truck actually made the trip no problem I can&#39;t really blame Toyota for the tire um we can blame Falcon I&#39;m not really sure what happened again to the tire I I&#39;ve always been a BF Goodrich ko2 guy for my allterrain tires but this truck came with the Falcons on it and I wasn&#39;t going to buy a new car and then immediately replace brand new tires with a tire I prefer is stupid that&#39;s a waste of money so I figured I&#39;d at least see how the Falcon wild Peak tires did and I have to say the real the real Crux of this video the the big conclusion is the truck was great um aside from these issues which are very minor the they just happen to add together at once which kind of is annoying but aside from these issues the truck was great and and I I needed a vehicle that could do three things which was haul as many people as possible go off-road as best as possible and have good driver Assist Technology and this truck I used all three of those things immensely all summer and it did a great job off-road it is the I have taken a lot of vehicles off-road in the east coast where I go it is it is the best of all of the cars that I&#39;ve ever had there better than my my G wagon better than my new lover defender or old one um just absolutely effortless off the pavement really really amazing uh the Toyota&#39;s multi-terrain select feature you can select the terrain you&#39;re on does a fantastic job of figuring out exactly how to handle any terrain situation I have never felt more confident off-roading any vehicle than my new seoa the self the driver Assist Technology is fantastic the the self-driving Steers for you it accelerates it breaks all you have to do is kind of rest a hand on the steering wheel and it&#39;ll do it all fantastic it won&#39;t do Lane changes for me but I don&#39;t really care that much about that I more care that it kind of can keep the line in the road if it curves without much input from me and it does that and it does it beautifully and it did a great job and then the number of people I maxed out the seating capacity seven seats in that car I maxed it out I maxed out the seating capacity while off-roading several times and it just does a great job at handling all of it there were some haters of the seoa when I bought it my wife some of my family members some of my friends they think it&#39;s big they think it&#39;s too brwy and aggressive looking they think it&#39;s a little stupid it kind of won everybody over throughout the summer just because of how effortless effortless it was to handle everything I needed to do you need to put the whole PE the whole crew in the car and go somewhere done you need to go off-roading and and pull out a car done I rescued with the Sequoia I rescued two vehicles this this summer uh on the beach that got stuck on the sand uh one of which was a heavyduty 2500 Chevy Silverado that&#39;s a heavy big vehicle and it had gotten really buried in there and the seoa pulled it out like it was nothing and it was just a really really really good vehicle so it&#39;s kind of funny because the trip had some problems there were some issues there were some incidents uh but overall I I I I arrive home this tooa is incredibly dirty it doesn&#39;t have the wheel on a tire the windshields cracked but I arrived home actually in a much better frame of mind about it than I had left I really am impressed with exactly how it was able to handle everything I threw at it and frankly I&#39;m really happy that I chose the Sequoia over all of the other options none of which really kind of did everything and checked every box that the Sequoia did um I still do have the same complaints about the Sequoia that I had in the video I made maybe 3 months ago explaining you know what was good and what was bad the ride quality could be better the technology within the gauge cluster screen could be better it doesn&#39;t really display like map or music which is really disappointing and I still hate the camo flage seats and fender flares now every time I post about this people say well why don&#39;t you just paint the fender flares I&#39;ve mentioned before I&#39;ll mention again you cannot paint or wrap the fender flares in the TRD Pro seoa because they are textured camouflage they went beyond just regular camouflag they really screwed you in texture and Camo so in order to paint it or wrap it properly you would have to sand it Bondo and I&#39;m just not going to devote that level of energy to Toyota sea sorry it&#39;s costly and stupid uh I&#39;d rather just complain about it as I&#39;ve mentioned I also can exchange them for fender flares on a different Sequoia because the TRD Pro has marker lights built into the fender that the other models don&#39;t have so that they don&#39;t exchange so that&#39;s that&#39;s the drawback but honestly the seoa I now have 8,500 miles on it it did fantastically it checked a lot of great boxes and I have no regrets at all about purchasing it I&#39;m really glad I did and I&#39;m going to get it back in its good condition get an oil change get another key get the tire back on it and it&#39;ll be ready for its next adventure and there will be more to come because I am I Am A Satisfied Sequoia buyer even though it&#39;s massive and poor riding and camouflaged and aggressive looking it did what I needed it to do and it did it well so there you go that is my trip cross country a little eventful a little bit crazy uh and that&#39;s what happened driving the Sequoia cross country again A Satisfied Sequoia buyer something I never thought I would be never thought I&#39;d get a giant SUV but here I am and it works great [Applause] [Music]"
