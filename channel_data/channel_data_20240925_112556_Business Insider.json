      "subtitles": "think back to the year 2009 Barack Obama had just been elected the original Gossip Girl was still on the air and Lady Gaga was inescapable that was also the last time the federal minimum wage was increased it&#39;s hard to imagine that in this day and age $725 an hour is a livable wage that&#39;s just $115,000 a year and it&#39;s well below the poverty level for families so is a minimum wage hike on the table when a new president takes over the White House the federal minimum wage was first implemented in 1938 under FDR back then it was just 25 cents an hour it&#39;s steadily risen overtime since but business insiders Emily Stewart says in recent years it&#39;s been stuck and states and cities have put their own wage standards in place Arizona&#39;s minimum for example is 1435 California&#39;s is 16 and West Virginia is date 75 but lots of businesses nowadays are paying more because the market demands it they&#39;ve had to increase pay to compete for workers and just to get them in the door just look at Walmart workers there now start at 14 an hour you hear stories about people going by fast food restaurants in Texas or really pick your state or or city and seeing ads for $14 $15 $16 outside of fast food restaurants it&#39;s it&#39;s really tough to pay the $725 today low-wage workers generally make more than their state&#39;s minimum wage basically everywhere rais it would lock in gains for workers even in the event of a downturn and there are spool over effects to hiking pay that would help more than the lowest paid people every time anybody talks about raising the minimum wage businesses act like the sky is falling all hell will break loose that they will have to lay everyone off that they all shut down but much of the evidence suggests that&#39;s not the case when people have more money in their pockets they can spend it at the grocery store at the restaurant down the street after Seattle raised its minimum wage in 2014 it&#39;ss businesses had a 99.3% survival rate and the Libra Market wasn&#39;t as strong as it is now research suggests a higher minimum wage can increase worker productivity and lower turnaround costs for businesses because better paid workers stick with their employers longer I don&#39;t want to ignore the risks here in Seattle some workers did see their hours go down as businesses tried to compensate for having to pay them more though most of them still did see an increase in their net pay and less experienced workers teens in particular had a harder time finding jobs the Congressional budget office has this calculator that let you play around with its estimates of the effects of a federal minimum wage Hike It predicts a higher minimum wage would lift families out of poverty though it also anticipates some job loss depending on how high the wage is you can understand why that&#39;s scary for workers higher pay only helps if you keep your job still more recent hikes like California&#39;s new $20 minimum wage for fast food workers haven&#39;t put tons of people out of work their could be an impact on consumers too because businesses pass some wage increases into their prices let&#39;s say your burrito costs 10 cents more but that&#39;s because the guy behind the counter who&#39;s making that burrito is making a living wage and that feels like a worthwhile trade-off to me it&#39;s impossible to predict exactly what a higher federal minimum wage would do a lot of the effect would depend on the labor market competition geography and obviously the amount for a long time progressives were pushing for $15 they&#39;ve now increased that to 177 because of inflation but it&#39;s hard to know the right amount but I do think you know you have to figure in Washington supposedly the land of compromise there&#39;s really a ton of space between 725 and 15 or 17 and they could pick something in there that might makes sense it&#39;s unlikely minimum wage will be increased this year but it could be on the agenda in 2025 kamla Harris has been talking about raising it so maybe next year it will be brought up again [Music]"

      "description": "One of the most expensive mattresses on the market is made from natural latex. It\u2019s hypoallergenic, biodegradable, and more durable than memory foam. You can buy a memory-foam mattress for a few hundred dollars, but natural latex mattresses usually cost over $1,500 and can exceed $2,000. Latex sap from rubber trees is in high demand from dozens of industries, including car tires. This high demand has caused deforestation and displacement of farmers in places like Cambodia. Some mattress companies source their latex from organic and fair-trade-certified farms in places like Guatemala, but the latex from these farms comes at a premium compared to the latex from noncertified plantations. We explored why natural latex mattresses are so expensive.\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n0:50 Rubber tree tapping\n2:15 Natural latex harvesting\n4:38 Processing raw latex\n5:27 Making a mattress\n6:29 Certifications\n7:37 Natural latex industry\n\nEditor's note: We're clarifying a statement made at 0:22.  While natural latex is resistant to dust mites, mold, and mildew, the latex itself can still be considered an allergen. Avocado does not claim that its mattresses are hypoallergenic and recognizes that they might not be appropriate for those with an existing latex allergy.

Soldiers named it the Warthog because of its \"ugly\" appearance and the guttural sound created by the Avenger.\n\nThe A-10 has been at the center of a debate within the US Armed Forces about whether or not the nearly 50-year-old aircraft should be retired  in favor of the more modern F-35 Fighter Jet.\n\nInsider visited Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, to see how pilots are trained to fly the Warthog.\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nHow Navy Sailors Train To Work On $2 Billion Submarines | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/VVLnYxSYfAY\nHow Army Medics Are Trained To Save Lives In Combat | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/C0AGQTnSkhs\nHow US Snipers, Tankers, Navy Sailors And More Are Trained | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/Adi5F2BwasM\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#AirForce #BootCamp #InsiderBusiness \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nHow Air Force Pilots Fly The Controversial $19 Million A-10 Warthog | Boot Camp | Insider Business",

It's a tiring journey in which the fish builds up its strength and muscle. The cold waters of the Copper River are challenging for fishers too, who set sail with no guarantee they will catch any fish at all. So is Copper River king salmon worth the challenge? And why is it so expensive?\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: In a previous version of the video, the chart at 11:02 was incorrect featuring the years in the incorrect order.

      "description": "A kilogram of jasmine oil can cost $5,000. But to get that small amount of oil, harvesters need to handpick over 5,000 jasmine buds. Once the flower blooms, producers in India quickly process it into one of the priciest absolute oils in the world. Today, jasmine oil is an integral ingredient in many luxury perfumes, including Dior's J'Adore, Guerlain's Shalimar, and Chanel No. 5. So, what does jasmine oil smell like? And why is it so expensive?\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS:\nWhy Japanese Iron Kettles Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9bt1W4SyRI\nWhy Calacatta Marble Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W5HisI7LmA\nWhy Benitoite Gemstones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXut69PYiAE\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#JasmineOil #SoExpensive #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Jasmine Oil Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider",

      "description": "Dijon mustard has a tangier, sharper, and spicier flavor compared to other types of mustard. It takes its name from the town of Dijon in Burgundy, France, where it originated. But despite its name, the majority of Dijon mustard that is sold all over the world doesn\u2019t come from France. The few jars that do will cost you up to 6 times more than regular Dijon mustard (or double if we want to compare it to Grey Poupon). So how is real Dijon mustard different? And why is it so expensive?\n\nEditor's Note: In this video, the translations at 2:10 and 3:16 are incorrect. The rind of the mustard seed is wrongly referred to as \u201csound of mustard\u201d. The correct translation is mustard bran. Insider regrets the error.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE FOOD VIDEOS:\nWhy Miyazaki Mangoes Are So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRyWyWIWhrc\nWhy Ant Egg Caviar Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF62ss_CBlM\nWhy 5 Of The World's Priciest Salts And Spices Are So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60Myw4fYyBM\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Mustard #SoExpensiveFood #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Real Dijon Mustard Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Business Insider",

      "description": "Brazil nuts are one of the most sustainable nuts. They're not grown on farms. They're collected in the rainforest after they drop naturally off wild trees. While the nuts support Indigenous tribes' livelihoods, collectors have a tough job. They have to hike deep into the jungle, avoiding deadly falling nuts and wildlife, all to haul 100-pound loads back out. And now their industry is at risk because of low prices for their nuts and illegal clear-cutting of the rainforest. We visit the Apiak\u00e1 tribe in Mato Grosso, Brazil, to see how they're using Brazil nuts as a weapon against deforestation.\n\nEditor's Note: At 0:37, 4:06, and 4:59, this video incorrectly used tons instead of kilos as a unit of measurement. At 6:11, this video also incorrectly stated that Brazil nuts are one of the cheapest nuts. Insider regrets the errors.\n\nMore Big Business Videos:\nWhy Salt Farmers Risk Their Lives To Harvest Desert Salt For $4 A Ton | Big Business\nhttps://youtu.be/vXDoofWyHP8\nWhy Florida Oranges Had The Worst Harvest Since World War II | Big Business | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/VZ_xwRhGH54\nWhy 99% Of Smithsonian's Specimens Are Hidden In High-Security | Big Business | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/Oese1nrwXk0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Brazil #AmazonRainforest #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nHow 40,000 Tons Of Brazil Nuts Are Collected Deep In The Amazon Rainforest | Big Business",

Insider spent five days at Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, where we observed recruits at various stages of their 10-week boot camp. During the fourth week of training, recruits learn how to properly don an M50 gas mask and are exposed to CS gas in the \"confidence chamber.\" While wearing a gas mask, the recruits watch as an instructor burns a CS capsule over a hot plate, filling the chamber with gas. Recruits then remove their masks completely and experience the full effects of tear gas.\n\nFor the first time ever, our crew was allowed to film inside any branch or agency's tear gas chamber, and in order to truly understand the effects of CS gas, Insider chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan decided it was time to experience the confidence chamber himself\u2026\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nWhat Navy Recruits Go Through In Boot Camp | Boot Camp | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63G8eh_Ps_M\nEvery Uniform In A Navy Sailor's Seabag | Loadout | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-QGTqphWE\nHow Military Dogs Are Trained | Boot Camp | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xit5GR_Nm10\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#TearGas #BootCamp #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Navy Sailors Train Inside A Tear Gas Chamber In Boot Camp | Boot Camp | Business Insider",

These wells have no owner and they were never sealed, so they're leaking out tons of methane and deadly gases unchecked. Some are 150 years old, and were lost with time. So finding and plugging them with cement can be so costly, most states don't have the funds to do it. But with $4.7 billion in funds to address this problem passed with the Infrastructure Bill, there's renewed hope.

Here, the Agariya people do the dangerous job of farming salt.

They make just $4 a ton, while traders take home most of the profits. So how did the Agariyas become trapped in the big business of salt?

      "title": "What Army Tankers Go Through In Boot Camp | Boot Camp | Business Insider",
      "description": "We got an inside look at how the United States Army trains tankers and cavalry scouts during its 22-week One Station Unit Training. Chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan went inside the Armor School in Fort Benning, Georgia, where he observed soldiers at various stages of training.\nAfter completing 10 weeks of basic combat training, soldiers go through 12 more weeks of advanced instruction. Future tankers learn how to drive, fire, and maintain the M1 Abrams battle tank, which has been the Army's primary tank since the Gulf War. Soldiers also learn how to load the tank's ammunition rounds, which range in weight from about 30 to 60 pounds.\nAlong with tankers, the Armor School trains cavalry scouts, whose mission is to perform reconnaissance and gather intelligence in the field and report to leadership, who may decide to utilize armored weapons and vehicles based on the scouts' reports. Cavalry scouts also train with anti-armor weapons like grenade launchers and rocket launchers.\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nEvery Piece Of Gear In An Army Cavalry Scout\u2019s 72-Hour Bag | Loadout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsbn93lT8eo\nHow Army Soldiers Train To Fight Hand-To-Hand In Boot Camp | Boot Camp\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUhuZrfh0hQ\nEvery Piece Of Gear In A Military Dog Handler\u2019s Field Bag | Loadout\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8fpEgydyoY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#ArmyTankers #BootCamp #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhat Army Tankers Go Through In Boot Camp | Boot Camp | Business Insider",

      "description": "Florida oranges had their worst crop in 70 years. They're facing a deadly disease called citrus greening, spread in the body of the invasive Asian citrus psyllid. Today, nearly every citrus grove in Florida is infected with the disease. If an orange tree were to remain untreated, the disease would block its ability to get nutrients and kill it within a few years. But Florida's growers have figured out a way to keep growing edible oranges, even on infected trees. They've implemented a slew of horticultural techniques developed with scientists at the University of Florida, from pink clay to reflective mulch. But they still haven't found a long-term cure. We went to central Florida to see how growers and scientists are keeping the big business of oranges alive.\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS:\nWhy 99% Of Smithsonian's Specimens Are Hidden In High-Security | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oese1nrwXk0\nHow The World\u2019s Longest-Running Sardine Cannery Packs 60 Million Cans A Year | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgaQ8-WbKE\nSoviets Banned Matzo, Now Ukraine Supplies The $110 Million American Market | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pie6X2GG-s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#FloridaCitrus #BigBusiness #BusinessInsider\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\nBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcj\nBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29T\nBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGF\nBI on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBoot Camp on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Boot_Camp/3383377771\n\nWhy Florida Oranges Had The Worst Harvest Since World War II | Big Business | Insider Business",
