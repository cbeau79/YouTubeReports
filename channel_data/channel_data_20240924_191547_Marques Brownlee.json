      "subtitles": "(groovy hip-hop music) - So it&#39;s a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones\non the day they come out. And we&#39;re upholding\nthis tradition this year to find one single difference\nversus last year&#39;s unboxings. So we&#39;ve got four iPhones\nhere in new colors: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, which the boxes show\nthe back of the phones. And then iPhone 16 Pro\nand iPhone 16 Pro Max, which show the front. And I&#39;m totally gonna\nstart with the base phones, the crowd favorites this year. Finally, some colors back\nin the iPhone lineup. So, I&#39;m gonna call this\none the flagship color. This is the Ultra Marine iPhone 16. And in the box, you get the USB-C cable, again, braided and high quality, and then a tiny little bit of\npaperwork in this pill shape. And then you&#39;ll notice no SIM\ncard tool, same as last year, and no stickers this year. There are no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box at all. Truly the end of an era. They just can&#39;t stop removing things, they can&#39;t help themselves. But let&#39;s get a look at the\npink plus-sized phone, too. These phones are the\nsame sizes as last year: 6.1 inches for the base,\n6.7 inches for the Plus. But with the bigger batteries inside, that&#39;s something I&#39;m\nreally happy to hear about and very curious about in my testing. But really, I&#39;m just happy\nwe finally have colors back. So the back of the phone,\nit&#39;s a little more pale, but the glass around the\ncamera is a bit darker, the rails of the phone are a\nbit darker, so this is nice. Same stuff in the box. Now, with these Pro phones, I think there&#39;s a reason they show the front of the phone on the box because, if they showed the back, you literally could\nnot tell the difference versus last year. But hey, at least this one has slightly thinner bezels they can show. And yeah, this year is gonna be the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro. And aside from the lack\nof stickers in the box, it&#39;s gonna look and feel\nbasically exactly like a titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Same USB-C cable as the\nbase phone, as well. Great. But then, this is the\nnew flagship Pro color. The renders we saw at\nfirst were kind of weird, but this is the official\nDesert Titanium color. And you know, all of Apple&#39;s phones are, again, a bit more pale on the back, but they have more color on these rails, and that&#39;s definitely true again here. It&#39;s kind of like a light sand color but also feels similar\nto the gold of the past. But there you have it. That&#39;s the iPhone 16&#39;s\nunboxing experience. So, by the time you see this uploaded, that means I am deep\ninto my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review. So, definitely, get subscribed\nto see that when it drops. But if there are any things that you specifically\nwanna see talked about more or that haven&#39;t been talked about enough for the review of the phones, let me know in the comment section below. But I can still give you now some quick things that I&#39;ve\nnoticed in my first couple days, my first week of testing, some FAQs. So, first up, there is a size\ndifference versus last year. The base phones are the\nsame sizes, like I said, 6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes. But the Pro phones are both bigger. The iPhone 16 Pro goes\nfrom 6.1 to 6.3 inches, and even though it has thinner bezels, yes, the phone is slightly\ntaller and slightly wider. And then, the iPhone 16 Pro Max goes from 6.7 inches to\n6.9 inches diagonally, which is now just an\nabsolutely gigantic phone. I mean, it was already huge, but it&#39;s now even taller and wider. Biggest phone they&#39;ve ever made. If you look at it next\nto the Galaxy S24 Ultra, that&#39;s another absolutely\nhuge phone for some context, and that phone has a stylus in it. So obviously, Apple&#39;s put\nmore battery in this phone, which is great to see. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not going\nthe opposite direction of, like, making it thinner\nor shrinking the batteries. But yeah, just it&#39;s\ndefinitely good to know if you&#39;re going with the\nnew Pro Max this year, you are getting a truly huge, like, borderline tablet-sized phone. Also, random tidbit: Thanks to these new\ncameras up in the corners, these new iPhones are\nbig-time table rockers. Like, big-time uneven camera on the back. It&#39;s annoying to me &#39;cause I\ntype on the table sometimes. Anyway, I&#39;ve also been\ntaking some pictures and videos with the new cameras. I&#39;ll be taking and\nposting many, many more. If you wanna follow me on Instagram, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll see some more in the next couple of days,\nbut I&#39;ll link that below. My first impression is\nit&#39;s kind of remarkable how consistent Apple&#39;s\nimage processing pipeline is to get the same look every year. Like a lot of times, we see\ncompanies switch sensors. Even the Pixels switched sensors after using the same old one for a while, and the whole look kind of changed. But it really feels like year over year, no matter how many hardware changes, no matter how many sensor\nchanges these phones go through, they still just very much\nhave the iPhone look, which, I mean, makes sense. This just shallower depth of field from the larger physical sensor. I have also run some benchmarks. So these are the new Geekbench 6 scores for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones, which are new versus last year. Really not noticing, like, a huge difference in performance\nwith these brand-new phones. Obviously, you&#39;re gonna feel\nthat more at the very high end and in the long term as these phones age. But what Geekbench also did reveal is all of these phones across the board have eight gigs of RAM now. So, there&#39;s typically been\ndifferent amounts of RAM in the Pro phone versus the regular phone. Now, there&#39;s not. Now, they all have eight gigs of RAM. So Apple was giving us a\nlot of talk in that keynote about how these are the first phones built from the ground up\nfor Apple Intelligence. Is that what this means? I mean, you clearly need a lot of memory to run these AI models, and there&#39;s also a more\npowerful neural engine on all the phones versus last year. So maybe that&#39;s a part of it, too. But all that talk and these\nphones all launch with iOS 18.0, which has exactly zero Apple\nIntelligence features on them at launch out the box. But that&#39;s a rant for another day. But clearly, the biggest\nphysical new change on these new phones is\nthis added button here. And Apple refused to call\nit a button in the keynote and then doubled down. They also did a bunch of,\nlike, executive interviews on various YouTube channels that you can go watch from that day, and even in those interviews, they continue to refuse\nto call it a button. It&#39;s so weird. - To just put out the\nbiggest burning fire, right up front, in the discourse. It is a real button, right? - Ah!\n(group laughing) - It&#39;s a physical thing\nthat depresses, right? - I think it&#39;s a first of its kind. There is a tactile switch, that\ngives you that final click. - So, just to clear it up, it is an actual moving\nclicking physical button that is called Camera Control. (laughs) But it&#39;s more than a button. It&#39;s also made it to all these\nphones, not just the Pros. So, let me jump into that. This Camera Control button,\nas the name implies, only controls camera-related things. So it&#39;s not like another Action button, it&#39;s a Camera Control button. You can hit it once it\nopens up the camera, you can hit it again to take a photo, and then you can hold it down to start recording a quick video. But it&#39;s also a large capacitive touch-sensitive surface with\na vibration motor underneath. So it doesn&#39;t actually half-press, but with that vibration motor, it can mimic the feeling of a half-press, like a real camera would have. And you can double-tap to flip through various\ncamera controls like zoom or photographic styles, or tone. It takes some getting used to. I mean, these swipes, they also you can see\nhave momentum physics too, so you can swipe too fast or too far and go past what you were aiming for or zoom past where you thought you would. So it can feel a bit finicky and silly as you start using it, especially since you can\nliterally do all this stuff with the buttons already on the screen. But when you use Camera Control, all of the rest of those\nbuttons just fade away and disappear, kind of\nencouraging you to continue using the Camera Control to find\nwhat you&#39;re trying to do. It&#39;s really interesting. The placement feels like it was\nmade with landscape in mind, but landscape ideally\nwould&#39;ve been at the corner. But they also know a lot\nof people take photos and videos like this, so it can&#39;t be all the way at the bottom. So they moved it up. So, it&#39;s kind of splitting\nthe difference here. And also, third-party apps\nwill be able to plug into it if they use the camera. So this is already working with Kino, and it&#39;s supposed to start working with Snapchat pretty soon as well. And you can imagine other\napps that use the camera will just decide what\nthey wanna do with it. I was also curious, though, and I said this in that\noriginal impressions video, how cases would deal with\nthis new button surface thing. So it turns out there&#39;s\nbasically two options. Option number one is just a\ncutout in the side of the case. Just cut it out, expose it to the finger. So it&#39;s fine. That&#39;s probably what\nmost cheap cases will do, but that also means it&#39;s\nno longer gonna be flush with the side of the case. But then there&#39;s option number two, which is what Apple&#39;s\nfirst-party cases do, which is putting in this\nlittle insert, which has glass and transfers the capacitance from the button outside of the case to the Camera Control of the phone itself and maintaining that flush feel. And it feels like it works pretty well. The half press still works fine, the swiping still works fine, the vibration motor transfers through. And the Beats by Dre cases\nalso already have this. Yeah, I&#39;m just gonna say\nthat again real quick in case you were just\nphasing out for a second. There&#39;s Beats by Dre iPhone\ncases now. (chuckles) Like, since when does Beats make cases? Like, why does Beats make cases? I thought, I don&#39;t know,\nthere was a theme of, like, Beats being audio products, but there&#39;s something new going on here. Maybe now they&#39;re just iPhone accessories? I don&#39;t know. But yeah, they&#39;ve got a nice little Camera Control button thing\non their new iPhone cases, which is nice. I kind of wish, and I&#39;m not alone, that this was also Touch ID, but then they couldn&#39;t call\nit Camera Control, I guess. I wonder if that&#39;s in the\nfuture of this button. But anyway, speaking of\nthird-party accessories, that&#39;s where dbrand stepped\nin to sponsor this video. So, for this sponsor segment,\nwe&#39;re gonna be doing something a little bit different. See, screen protectors,\nnot my favorite thing. They&#39;re kind of a chore to install, between the dust and the\nalignment and getting it perfect. That&#39;s a big part of why I\ndon&#39;t use them all the time. But that&#39;s where channel\nsponsor dbrand comes in. They seem to believe that I can install their Prism 2.0 screen\nprotector blindfolded. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna try to do. Instructions that I&#39;ve been\ntold are pretty simple. To just get the screen protector, get the phone, and then line it up. Which is like that. (fingers tapping) And then pull the tab like that. (plastic tab rustling) And then just swipe down\nthe middle to press it down. Give it a couple seconds. And then that should be it. Let&#39;s see. Take this off. (installation frame clunking) And that doesn&#39;t even\nlook like it&#39;s installed. But it is. It totally is. And it&#39;s perfect. Nice. Okay. Yeah, every Prism comes with two of these, so if you get the first one\nwrong, you can get a second try. But if you wanna check\nthese out for the iPhone or any number of phones\nthat they make for it, I&#39;ll have a link below. All right. That&#39;s been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (groovy hip-hop music)"

      "subtitles": "(bright music) - Okay, so there were rumors,\nthere were serious rumors that the 10th generation Apple Watch was gonna be the one that\ngets this huge redesign. Like, remember the iPhone 10, that sort of reset the design language of the whole iPhone line? And 10 is just such a nice\nround even number, right? So we just kind of figured that maybe the Apple Watch\nwould do the same thing. And I even remember in my last few years of reviewing the Apple Watch, Series 8, Series 9, I was like, &quot;Look, these are good watches, but clearly, very\nincremental improvements.&quot; &quot;So if you want a big upgrade, maybe wait till the 10th gen one.&quot; And so now here we are, I&#39;ve been using Apple Watch\nSeries 10 for the past week, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s.... it&#39;s definitely another\nincremental upgrade. Now, you know, that&#39;s not\nnecessarily a bad thing. Obviously, it&#39;s not as\nexciting as a total redesign, but that definitely makes\nthis review pretty simple as far as whether you\nshould get one or not. The main physical differences\nthis time on the outside are, it&#39;s slightly thinner\nand lighter and bigger. So the numbers say 10% thinner and 10% lighter for the aluminum one, and then they actually\ndrop stainless steel in favor of titanium\non the higher-end ones, so that&#39;s 20% lighter. And the screens of both\nsizes are now even bigger. And the result is really\njust that you can see more, and it&#39;s just more\ncomfortable on the wrist. In fact, it actually just feels like someone took last year&#39;s Apple Watch and just squashed it down a little bit. And there you go, that&#39;s the new design. And of course, it&#39;s more\ncomplicated than that. Like, there is a new metal\nback that&#39;s one piece now, and there&#39;s a new re-engineered\nspeaker that&#39;s 30% smaller, so it can fit in this, and just other pieces like shuffled around to fit in this new shape. But the end result is very much\nstill an incremental update instead of some dramatic new form factor. I actually think now this\nvisually reminds me more than ever of a Pixel Watch just depending\non what face you have, just because of the way the\ntop edges are curved even more, and the way everything just\nkind of melts into the sides, especially with this new Jet Black color. It&#39;s just way bigger. In fact, it&#39;s true the larger 46-millimeter\nApple Watch Series 10 basically now runs the same screen size as the Apple Watch Ultra. And Apple loves to do that thing, where they show an older\nwatch on the screen, and then the newer watch with\na bigger screen next to it, and brag about how, &quot;Hey\nthere&#39;s a bigger screen so you can get even more text, and even more content on the screen, and it&#39;s easier to type on\nthat onscreen keyboard.&quot; And to be honest, it never really made that much of a big difference to me other than maybe the Ultra. But this year, I noticed\nsomething very specific. The Disc Sports Workout now shows one extra line of information. So instead of time, active calories, total calories, and heart rate, it now shows me time, active calories, total calories, heart rate... and miles. So, there&#39;s that. I think watchOS 11 literally just adds an extra line of text in some instances with these bigger screens,\nwhich is kind of funny. But speaking of watchOS 11, that launches on these new watches and gets pushed as a software update to some older Apple Watches. So you&#39;re gonna get things\nlike the new Vitals app, which gives you a sort of energy score, kind of like the Garmin Body Battery. And there&#39;s a sleep apnea detection, which just got FDA approval\nto detect and notify you of potentially high levels of sleep apnea using only the accelerometer. And there&#39;s training load as well, which keeps track of the\nperceived intensity of workouts. That stuff is nice, and it&#39;s also, like I said, coming to some older\nApple Watches as well. So if you really wanna know what stuff is specifically\ncoming just to this newest watch, so like a reason to get this one, then there&#39;s about four\nthat you should know about. Okay, so let me know if these are enough to convince you to get this newest watch. So number one, with\nthis redesigned speaker, you can now listen to media\nout loud on the watch. So meaning you could already like take phone calls\nand set alarms and stuff, but now you can literally just play media, like music or podcasts\nor audio books out loud. So you could be on a hike and\njust forget your headphones, and just... you could be that guy. But don&#39;t, don&#39;t be that guy. So the number two, this is\nnow an updated LTPO 3 display, which means it&#39;ll go all the way down to 1 hertz instead of 10 hertz. So now it can show the\nsecond hand all the time when the Always On Display is on because it doesn&#39;t take up extra battery. Plus, it has slightly noticeably better off-axis viewing angles, which actually helps for a watch, so you can sort of glance and check the watch and still see it without looking like\nyou&#39;re checking your watch. Then number three, there is a\nnew water temperature sensor. So here&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t know if you can\ntell by looking at me, but I don&#39;t really spend too\nmuch time around deep water. So I don&#39;t have any test results for this particular new sensor, but it&#39;s there now. So.. great. But then number four, faster charging. So cared about this one? Turns out, so if you use\nthe Puck that comes with it, this is how you maximize\nyour charging speed, you can now get it up\nto somewhere around 65% from dead in half an hour. It&#39;s supposed to be 80% actually, but we couldn&#39;t get it quite that fast. But nevertheless, the faster\ncharging speed is very welcome. And that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the new\nbig 10th generation update. There&#39;s also the new S10 SiP inside, which doesn&#39;t seem to be noticeably faster or better at anything than in the S9. It has an improved neural engine but hasn&#39;t been enabling\nanything that the S9 can&#39;t do. So yeah, is that enough? And the more I thought about it, honestly, my take is that now that Apple\nhas called this a redesign. Like, if you watch the keynote, they were like, &quot;This is a huge deal.&quot; &quot;This is a big new 10th\ngeneration redesign.&quot; Now that they&#39;ve done that, I&#39;m fairly sure that that means that this is what the Apple\nWatch is going to look like for the next 5 to 10 more years. Like, if this is a real\nredesign for Apple, then we&#39;re gonna be back to even smaller changes from here on. Really, the only parts of this update that made a big difference at all to me are the larger display\nand faster charging. The larger display for obvious reasons. The faster charging is nice, especially just &#39;cause\nif you wanna drop it on a charger for a few minutes and get a bunch of use, then you can. I would find it even better if I was doing sleep tracking as well. But I&#39;ve mentioned this before, I&#39;m not because I&#39;m using the Eight Sleep for all my sleep tracking metrics, and so shout out to Eight Sleep for sponsoring this portion of the video. The Eight Sleep has been so good to me, which is why I&#39;m mentioning\nit in previous videos. And you&#39;ve already heard\nabout this new one, the Pod 4 Ultra, which can get super cool or super warm to each side\nof the bed independently. But also, yeah, it&#39;s doing\nthat biometric tracking with 99% accuracy no\nmatter how you&#39;re sleeping, which I think is actually an advantage over something on the back of your wrist. So then you just jump in the\napp and you can see, you know, here&#39;s the different stages of sleep here. I&#39;ve been waking up in the\nmiddle of the night randomly since coming back from\nAustralia&#39;s time zone, but this is a pretty\ngood night right here. You can see heart rate, heart\nrate variability, breath rate. No snoring, which is great. (chuckles) And it&#39;s helping me get back into my sleep routine\nhere on the East Coast, and it can help anyone\nsleep better, honestly. So you just add the Pod to your current mattress\nlike a fitted sheet, and it automatically cools down or warms up each side of the bed. So you can go to eightsleep.com/mkbhd and get $350 off Pod 4 Ultra, or 200 bucks off the Pod 4. And then you can also leave\nyour wearable on the nightstand. But okay, so if you have\nan older Apple Watch, Series 4, 5, 6, 7, and you want a new one, then okay, yeah, this\nis the upgrade to get. That&#39;s like the easiest,\nno-brainer conclusion in the world for this product. But I&#39;m going the extra step as a reviewer and predicting the future of this product, and just based on Apple&#39;s\nlanguage in their presentations, I really don&#39;t think we&#39;re\ngetting any planned big upgrades to this watch for a while,\nwhich is unfortunate. But like, all those major\nfeatures we are thinking about, like a rotating bezel,\nor a circular shape, or a meaningful\nimprovement to the battery, any of which would&#39;ve\nbeen the biggest change to the Apple Watch in years, we didn&#39;t get any of that\nwith this 10th gen redesign. So it feels like they&#39;re not\nplanning on doing any of it. So this is the 10th gen Apple watch, and this feels like\nApple&#39;s big statement of, &quot;This is the Apple Watch.&quot; (chuckles) It&#39;s the squircle, no rotating bezel, these are the buttons, this is the shape, 18-hour battery life, over and over again. Take it or leave it. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s the review. Thanks for watching. I&#39;ll catch you guys in\nthe next one, peace. (bright music)"

      "subtitles": "(upbeat music) - So there&#39;s two types\nof people in this world: Either AirPods fit in your ears or AirPods don&#39;t fit in your ears. There&#39;s two types of people in this world: You either love silicon-tipped in-earbuds or you hate silicon-tipped in-earbuds. There&#39;s two types of people in this world: people who really need noise cancellation and people who don&#39;t really care about it. But Apple wants both people&#39;s money. So there&#39;s two versions of\nthe new AirPods this year. It was kinda confusing\nthe way they announced it at the keynote, but essentially, for 129 there&#39;s the base AirPods 4, but then for 179 there&#39;s AirPods\n4 with noise cancellation. But that is not the only\ndifference between them. So now that I&#39;ve been\ntesting &#39;em for a few days, I can give you the verdict on them, what the differences are, and\nif they&#39;re actually worth it. So first of all, let&#39;s just start with\nthe AirPods themselves. They&#39;ve tweaked the shape\nof these buds again, and so they&#39;ve gotten some new\ncurves and some new angles, and the driver points a\nlittle bit more directly into your ear with less reflections. The stem is also a little bit shorter, but otherwise, I mean, yeah,\nthey still look like AirPods. They&#39;re very familiar. They have IP54 dust and water resistance, up from IPX4 last year. And they still have the in-ear detection, there&#39;s still microphones\nall the way around, but my biggest question personally, before anything else, was actually just, does this slightly new shape\nactually fit better in my ear? Because I have not had any luck with hard-tipped AirPods ever really, since they first came out. The latest version was the closest, like I could put them in my ears, but if I jogged for more\nthan about 10 seconds, they would just slowly fall out. So are the 4s actually better for me? Slightly, but not really. I put &#39;em in my ears. I was trying to, okay, let&#39;s\nsee if this is actually better. I kind of twist &#39;em a\nlittle bit, do the classic, like, you know, get &#39;em seated in my ear, but it&#39;s not for very long. They still slowly, even when\nI&#39;m just sitting around, slowly feel like they&#39;re\ncoming outta my ear. So I think if you had problems\nwith previous AirPods, you&#39;ll probably still\nhave problems with these, but if they fit in your ears, then these will also fit in your ears. Now, all of what I&#39;ve said so far is true about both the base AirPods and the active noise-canceling version. They&#39;re the same size,\nshame shape and everything. Like, you can&#39;t tell the difference from the outside of the buds. Where the differences start,\nthough, is this new case. So let&#39;s look at the case. The\ncase is a little bit smaller. It is USB type C, thank God. But with the base version, that&#39;s it. It&#39;s just a case with USB-C. With the noise-canceling headphones, the case also gets a small\nspeaker at the bottom so they can chime when it&#39;s charging and they make a noise when they&#39;re lost, and they have wireless charging on the back as well,\n(AirPods chime) which is super convenient. One thing I&#39;ve noticed, though, it doesn&#39;t have MagSafe anymore, I think because this case is literally just slightly too small now. So the last generation of AirPods, the case with wireless\ncharging would actually align and stick to the back\nof a MagSafe charger, which is really convenient\nfor just like dropping it on the charger, not thinking about it. But this year&#39;s case, you\nknow, slightly smaller. I think it&#39;s just a little bit smaller than the magnetic ring. So that&#39;s gone. So it&#39;ll still charge\non any cheat charger, but it does not stick to it\nfor any sort of alignment, which is kind of a bummer. So if you&#39;ve got one of\nthose upright chargers, then you try to stick it to\nit, it&#39;ll just slide off now. So USB type C, upside.\nMagSafe gone, downside. I also have noticed, and maybe it&#39;s just\n&#39;cause they&#39;re brand new, but it feels like the magnets holding them into the case just feels more secure. I think that&#39;s a good thing. And this case still works with\nApple Watch puck chargers, by the way, fun fact. This isn&#39;t a normal cheat charger at all. It literally only charges\nApple Watches and AirPods. But hey, they still do magnetize, so maybe that&#39;s worth something. And then for the hidden feature that nobody&#39;s mentioned in\nany of the presentations or keynotes or anything. Remember the back of AirPods 3, there was a little pairing button? So if you were manually\npairing it to a phone or something like that,\nyou would hit this button. That is gone from the new AirPods 4 case. So where did that go? And it turns out now it&#39;s a\nhidden capacitive touch area, kind of right underneath the\npairing light on the front. So you can double tap here,\nthen it starts blinking, and that initiates the pairing mode. And actually, a triple tap will allow you to start a factory reset of the buds. So no longer a physical\nbutton, kind of a hidden trick. The more you know. But the biggest question that I&#39;m sure most people\nare actually wondering is, how good is the Active Noise Cancellation on these new AirPods? Should you actually choose to get it without going AirPods\nPro with silicon tips? Is it actually good? So my point of reference is\ngoing to be AirPods Pro 2. You know, obviously there&#39;s\nlots of other earbuds that have ANC, but just sound quality, apples for apples wise, that&#39;s probably the\nmost direct comparison. And I&#39;ll say, while these are impressive, they are definitely not\nas good as the Pros. They&#39;re just not. And this is most definitely\nbecause of physics. So, since the hard tip doesn&#39;t\nabsolutely perfectly fit inside my ear one-to-one, it\njust means there&#39;s a little bit of air gaps around the\noutside of it, just a little. There&#39;s a little bit of\nsound that can make it from the outside into my ear,\nliterally around the earbud. So whether it&#39;s white noise,\nor street sounds, or voices, the ANC clearly works,\nand it does a good job of basically lowering the background noise so you can hear whatever\nyou&#39;re listening to better, but it&#39;s not quite gone. So I feel like if AirPods\nPro are like an 8 outta 10 for noise cancellation,\njust based on how much of the background noise it&#39;s removing, these hard-tipped AirPods\nare around like a four, maybe four or five. It&#39;s less noise cancellation and more noise reduction,\nif that makes sense. Like, still very useful, but it&#39;s most useful in\nparticularly loud environments. Like, if you&#39;re on a train or on a plane or with like a lot of loud voices or street sounds around you, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll most\nappreciate the reduction in noise because you can hear what\nyou&#39;re actually trying to listen to better. But if you&#39;re in a quiet room, or a library, or something like that, it doesn&#39;t actually make\nthat much of a difference. But then, probably just as important as noise cancellation, is\nevery pair of headphones that has that should also\nhave transparency mode. And these do. And this might be the best\ntransparency mode I&#39;ve ever heard on any AirPods. Sounds supernatural probably\nbecause literally some of the outside environment\nnoise is already getting in, and so what it boosts in\nthrough the microphones should sound just like it. Some other small tidbits about these: Battery life does technically\nget slightly worse with ANC on. So it&#39;s rated for four\nhours, still respectable, but a total of 20 hours with the case with noise cancellation. These also now join AirPods Pro with USB-C as the only other headphones to have the ultra-low latency\nsupport for Vision Pro. So thanks, H2 chip. And then precision finding is useful, but that speaker does really help if they&#39;re kind of underneath something, or inside a bag, or you need to find it but don&#39;t\nreally have a visual on it. Love having the speaker on the case. And then if you were paying\nreally close attention in the last Apple keynote,\nyou might have caught that there was actually\nalso an AirPods Max refresh alongside these. But I use the word\nrefresh like very lightly just because all they really\ndid was make it USB type C and some new colors, and that&#39;s it. Literally, that&#39;s it. They didn&#39;t do any other, no mesh updates, no case updates, no on/off switch, no material updates, no driver updates, no sound quality changes, no new features, no H2 chip, just USB-C. That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous. And I will not be\nreviewing those headphones, but what I did see is some\ncomments of people asking, like, &quot;Wait, what is the\nH2 chip even all about? Like, does it matter that the new ones didn&#39;t get the H2 chip?&quot; So let me just break down what that&#39;s for. The H2 chip inside these\nAirPods is basically doing all of the processing, especially\nfrom these microphones. So all of the improved\nbackground noise reduction for phone calls, all of the\nActive Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and Adaptive Audio. And it also now lets you nod or shake your head to\nanswer Siri questions. So if there&#39;s like an incoming call and it announces a new call,\nyou can literally nod your head to answer it instead of talking out loud. Or if you get a text and Siri\nasks, &quot;Do you wanna respond,&quot; but you don&#39;t want to, you\nliterally just shake your head. It actually works super well. But then it&#39;s also just\na matter of principle. Like, there&#39;s no way\nyour brand-new, flagship, $550 over-ear noise-canceling headphones shouldn&#39;t have all the latest and greatest parts\ninternally and externally, but here we are. But anyway, the sound quality of these new AirPods is perfectly solid. Some people were surprised at my opinion about this last time, but the AirPods 3 did take a\npretty respectable step up. And while there still is no EQ anywhere and there&#39;s not a whole lot\nof customization to the sound, they do a good job of sort of\nbeing decent at everything. &#39;Cause these have to do\nphone calls and podcasts, which have a lot of vocal frequencies, but they also have to do movies, and they also have to do music, and they&#39;re kind of just tuned\nto be solid at everything. So overall, 129 for the base AirPods, 179 for the AirPods with\nActive Noise Cancellation. Now you know all the differences. Now you know what they do\nand how good they are at it, and you can choose which\none you want for yourself. Me personally, I&#39;m still a silicon ear tips\nperson just for my own EarPods. Like, they fit in my ears so much better, the seal is so much better, it makes the noise cancellation\ndramatically better. So I&#39;m still leaning\nAirPods Pro for myself. Matter of fact, you can\nget AirPods Pro on Amazon for like 199 right now, so it&#39;s only 20 bucks more than these. But I still think people will\nhappily save the 20 bucks and get the hard-tipped ones. They still get beat in\nindividual categories by others in the wide world of other earbuds available out there. Like, some will have a\nbetter fit in the ear, which will be better for working\nout and running and stuff. Some others will have better battery life, and even some others will\nhave better sound quality, especially for music. But these are still AirPods,\nwhich means they work best with the ecosystem, with\nthe seamless switching between all of the Apple\ndevices in your life. And they still have that sort of generic useful frequency response\nacross the range for everything. That&#39;s what they&#39;re good at. Now, if you&#39;re thinking of\npicking up a new pair of AirPods but you don&#39;t love the dental floss look, well then channel sponsor\ndbrand has you covered with their new Area 51 case. And this isn&#39;t just some\nregular printed design. This topographical pattern\nhas a crazy like 3D-printed texture that you can actually feel. I honestly, I&#39;m not\nsure how they did this, but the 3D ink, it&#39;s super durable. It adds this extra layer of grippiness that&#39;s hard to describe. And this isn&#39;t just some random pattern. Apparently, dbrand put an\nactual topographical map of Area 51 on here, because\nof course they would. So there are three\ndifferent colorways of it. There&#39;s red, yellow, and black. And I&#39;m usually all in on matte black, but this is a nice yellow,\nit looks pretty sick. And these new Area 51 skins are available for a ton of different devices. So I&#39;ll leave a link\nbelow in the description if you wanna pick one up for yourself. But that&#39;s basically it. Thanks for watching, and I&#39;ll catch you very\nsoon in the next one. Peace.\n(bright upbeat music)"

      "subtitles": "(upbeat music) - So I&#39;ve made a few references\nover the past couple years to that time that the\nFBI visited the studio, and I was asked not to talk about that for what I feel like are\npretty obvious reasons. So for years I haven&#39;t, but it turns out I am now\nfinally able to tell that story. So here we are. So for those of you who don&#39;t\nknow, we have a studio here, and it&#39;s in a larger building with more tenants in it obviously. It&#39;s like an office building. It&#39;s not exactly like an office building, but you know, there&#39;s a front desk, and security and all that. And I&#39;ve been in this building long enough that we have a pretty good\nrelationship with them. So we have this one rule, basically. So there&#39;s the guy at\nsecurity at the front desk. We&#39;ll call him Bob, just for this. But Bob and I have this one rule, which is that if anyone ever\nshows up at the front desk and asks for me that\nhe doesn&#39;t let them in. I have to come out and meet them to confirm that I was expecting them, and then I bring them back to our studio. So if someone just randomly shows up, which you shouldn&#39;t, but if they do, and I don&#39;t show up at\nthe front to meet them, then I wasn&#39;t supposed to meet them. But if I have someone\ncoming and I expect them, I meet &#39;em outside. That&#39;s our one rule, and we stick to it. So in June, 2020, it was pretty early in this\nnew space that we have, and it&#39;s also right\naround like peak COVID. So I had sent everybody home, and it was just me and\nAndrew coming into the studio to work on basically building furniture, and making videos, and recording\nthe podcast every week. So I got here pretty early on\none of those summer mornings, and I&#39;m starting to get\nall my stuff settled, and then there&#39;s a knock on the door. (door knocks) So I open the door, and it&#39;s\nour front desk guy, Bob. And Bob basically says, &quot;Hey\nMarques, there&#39;s some people with badges at the front desk to see you. I, of course didn&#39;t let them in, but if you would like\nto, they&#39;re up there.&quot; And then he just walked away. And my first thought is confusion. I&#39;m like, what? What did I do on the way here that someone with badges\nwould show up asking for me? I&#39;m a little concerned. I&#39;m not sure what to think. So there was a solid\nminute where I just like stood there in the doorway,\nlike, okay, do I go up there, or do I just stay here in the studio without asking who the\npeople with badges are? Eh. And then I just went up to the front. I went up, I went up to the front desk, and sure enough, there&#39;s three\npeople with badges there, and they walk right up to me, and they all like flash their badges. FBI, just like the movies. Like FBI agent this, IRS agent this. And they&#39;re like,\n&quot;Marques, good to see you. We&#39;ve got some questions for\nyou about the Escobar phone.&quot; So immediately I&#39;m relieved, but I&#39;m like, oh, oh,\noh, the Escobar phone. Oh. Because see, a few months earlier I had published a video\nabout the Escobar Fold. If you guys haven&#39;t seen that video, basically the story goes,\nthere&#39;s this company parading around and selling\nthis $400 gold folding phone, which they&#39;re gonna use to\ndestroy Apple and Samsung. And they had these insane\nmarketing campaigns and all this. But really what they were doing,\nas I uncovered in my video, was covering Samsung Galaxy folds cheaply with like gold stickers, and then shipping them to YouTubers and people who they believed\nwould talk about it positively. And then not shipping\nany of the other orders from regular people or the audiences that watched those videos. Those people were getting\nscammed out of their money. And honestly, in hindsight,\nI don&#39;t know how they thought they were gonna get away with this. Like it felt pretty obvious to me. But, you know, eventually\ntheir whole plan backfired when I made a video\nabout the entire thing. So now fast forward a couple months, and it actually makes sense that the FBI and the IRS are interested. I just didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t realize they were just gonna show\nup one day, but here we are. But, you know, shout out\nto Bob at the front desk for sticking to our rule. Even though he probably\nhad a bunch of people like Flash FBI badges at\nhim, he stuck to our rule, and that was great. So I appreciate that. But yeah, so I came out, I\nbrought them back to our spot, and they basically then\nhad a bunch of questions about that video and the process of dealing\nwith that company in any way. Like any and all communications\nthat I had with them, any email I&#39;d ever sent or\nreceived from them ever, they wanted everything. And actually it was\nfunny, another tidbit is, Andrew at the time had\njust started running the business email account here. And when they were asking like, has anybody else on your\nteam possibly ever been in email communication with this company? And I was like, I think Andrew might&#39;ve. And Andrew just had arrived at the studio and walked up to the\nfront door of our spot. And so I like, I go, &quot;Hey, hey, come in.&quot; And you know, first thing he sees is like me in an empty studio with\na bunch of people in suits, like waving him over. So he has a pretty funny\nalternate perspective on this story. So the FBI actually took\nthe half peeled Escobar Fold and the scratched gold\niPhone from my videos as evidence in the case. They literally asked for\nthem and took them away. They put &#39;em in sealed plastic bags that said evidence on them, which is why I said at the\nend of the smartphone awards that year- Also honorable mention\nto the Escobar Fold 2, which I also don&#39;t have on this desk because it is in the\npossession of the FBI. Someday I&#39;ll be able to tell that story. So as they&#39;re leaving, you know, they&#39;ve asked me all the questions. As the FBI and IRS people are leaving, they&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t talk about this at all publicly, please.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Of course, yeah. No, obviously you&#39;re the FBI, of course I&#39;m not gonna talk about it. I don&#39;t want to interfere with\nthe investigation in any way. But also like, when could I talk about it? Like, how long do you think\nbefore I am allowed to?&quot; And they said, &quot;We&#39;ll let you know.&quot; So I&#39;ve been biting my tongue for years, not talking about it,\nhinting at it a little bit, but not anything too serious. But since then, a lot of the\ndominoes have started to fall. You know, at first when\nthe scam was happening, PayPal stopped working with them. So they&#39;d switched to\nthis only non-refundable direct transfer thing with Klarna. And then they stopped\nworking with them too. And then eventually the whole\noperation starts falling down, and the guy at the head of\nit named Olaf Gustafsson, this guy finally ends up getting arrested and going to prison in Spain for fraud, and money laundering, and\na bunch of other things, basically for everything\nthat I talked about in those videos. So I&#39;ve been holding onto\nthis not really knowing like, okay, is it cool now that he&#39;s\nbehind bars to talk about it? So we actually reached back\nout to those same FBI agents because they left their cards, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh yeah, no, it&#39;s cool\nnow to talk about it. You&#39;re totally fine.&quot; So there unfortunately is no footage of any of this incident, but there is these papers\nwhich they provided as proof that they received property to be used as evidence in the case. So one Pablo Escobar\nFold 2 mobile flip phone, AKA Samsung, and one Pablo Escobar\nGold 11 Pro mobile phone, AKA iPhone 11 pro. But hey, now you basically know the story. Yeah, pretty serious business out here, making videos about phones\nsometimes, you know? Apparently also, if this guy\nOlaf ever does get charged in the United States, then it&#39;s very likely my\nvideos would show up somewhere in those court documents, which is crazy. And also the phones that they\ntook may show up as evidence. But yeah, I do wanna get back\ninto a little more of the more investigative deep\ndive type of videos. Obviously the giant scams\ndon&#39;t happen very often, thankfully, in the tech world, but still they are fascinating\nstories when they do. And by the way, that&#39;s not the\nonly encounter that we&#39;ve had with the FBI in running\nthis YouTube channel, but that&#39;s another story for another day. But hey, if you want more\nfun stories like this one, let me know with the comments. But also the latest episode, the bonus episode of the Waveform podcast is just stories like this one\n(upbeat music) from the past couple years at the studio, whole story time episode. It&#39;s fun. So go over there and\nsubscribe and watch that. But yeah, that&#39;s basically it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (upbeat music) It&#39;s a story of how I became a villain. For at least 24 hours, I was hated. - A couple weeks, I would say. - Yeah, oh really? A couple weeks. Well, oh, &#39;cause the\nvideo had to come out. Hang on here for a second,\nI&#39;m gonna go get him. I literally wait there\nwith all my bags and stuff, and like this guy\ndisappears into this booth, comes back out with another guy. He goes, &quot;Hi. Oh, good to meet you.&quot; And he&#39;s filming me now. Okay. - Oh no. - So now he&#39;s filming me. A couple weeks later I log into YouTube, and everyone on Twitter&#39;s like, &quot;Why is Marques such a jerk?&quot;"

      "subtitles": "(upbeat music) - So we just got done with\npossibly one of the biggest Apple WWDC keynotes of all time, maybe, just because of the state of the world and what everyone expects\nfrom tech companies in 2024, which is AI at the front of what you do. Interestingly, with Apple this time, Apple had AI at the back\nhalf of what they did. Literally, the entire\nfirst half of the keynote, they didn&#39;t say AI once, zero times. Then the second hour,\nthey basically just went, &quot;All right, yeah, we, we actually do have a lot of AI stuff to share with you.&quot; And they just spit it all out. And of course they did manage to brand it because of course they did. AI for them is now Apple Intelligence. But look, I watched and live tweeted the entire two-hour long\nkeynote so you don&#39;t have to. And I&#39;ve gathered all my thoughts on all the most important announcements, so this is everything you\nneed to know that&#39;s new and some of my takes on it. So I&#39;m gonna go in the\nsame order that Apple went. I&#39;m gonna start with VisionOS, and we&#39;re already on,\nsomehow, VisionOS 2.0 less than half a year after the Vision Pro first got announced. And there are some solid new features, but I don&#39;t know if I\nwould call this 2.0 worthy. It feels more like a 1.2 update, but, okay, whatever, we&#39;ll go with it. So there&#39;s a new wrist turn gesture to quickly see the time and\nyour battery percentage, and then you can jump right from there into the control center, instead of having to look\nway up at the ceiling like you had to before every time. It kinda reminds me of the Oculus Quest. That is easy. That&#39;s an upgrade. There&#39;s a bunch of\nimmersive media features, like they let you go\nthrough your old photos and use advanced machine learning to turn them into spatial photos, which is really interesting if it works. And there are also new\ntools to help people create spatial videos and immersive videos on cameras other than the iPhone, but then of course you can\nonly view them on a Vision Pro. So who knows how valuable this\nwill actually turn out to be. But then, this year, Mac mirroring will get way more resolution thanks to it now doing the\nfoveated rendering on the Mac. So basically it frees\nup a ton of resources and it lets you do up to\ndouble the resolution. So you could do a gigantic\nultra wide if you want it to be. That is way more room for\nwindows and activities. Love that. And that&#39;s pretty much it. Again, it&#39;s not the biggest\n2.0 update we&#39;ve ever seen, but it does feel like there&#39;s\nsome nice updates in there, including some new environments and the ability to\nrearrange your home screen. Believe it or not, you\ncouldn&#39;t do that before. Now you can. But speaking of rearranging\nyour home screen, iOS just got one of the biggest or at least most interesting\nupdates in a long time. And I&#39;m just gonna... If you&#39;re an Android user, I&#39;d say for the next like\ntwo minutes, three minutes, just go ahead and unplug\nyour keyboard for a second and just relax. &#39;Cause yes, we&#39;ve had these\nfeatures for a long time, but now it&#39;s the iPhone&#39;s\ntime to shine, all right? So, officially, you will\nfinally be able to put icons wherever you want on the\niOS 18 home screen grid. And it was hilarious that this got a whole applause moment from\nthe audience during the keynote as if they just invented a new feature. But fine, you&#39;ve been waiting\nfor a long time for this. Have your fun. But they didn&#39;t stop there. They added a whole bunch of\nother customization features to the iPhone home screen too, and it started to get a\nlittle more interesting. See, there&#39;s this new theme engine now that lets you go in and change the color of every icon and widget\non your home screen to the same color. So you can match your wallpaper with your icons to frame it nicely and have matching colors everywhere. It&#39;s a simple thing and we&#39;ve been doing it on\nAndroid with launchers for years, but the thing about these is, before this moment, basically every iPhone home\nscreen looked the same. We&#39;ve been saying that. They&#39;ve just given you\nthe ability to go crazy and kind of ruin your home\nscreen if you want to, and people seem to absolutely want to. I have seen some rough home screens people are making on Twitter. A lot of them just look terrible. And I think the main thing\nI noticed is it seems like there are apps that support\nthis whole colored thing well, and then there are apps that don&#39;t, that just looks like\nit tints the entire... It just literally applies a color cast to the entire icon on your home screen, which causes all kinds\nof legibility problems. Doesn&#39;t look good. There are widgets that look horrible. It&#39;s just unreadable. So yeah, you can make some pretty-looking home screens if you want, but you can also make some\nreally ugly looking home screens. And I was trying to decide if I like this more or\nless than what Google did on the Pixels with Material You I think, technically, it&#39;s better because it works on all of the icons. I don&#39;t know how many setups I&#39;ve tried where I wanna do the monochrome icons, but there are just a few of\nmy apps that aren&#39;t supported, so they end up looking kind of, like they stick out like a sore thumb. So at least Apple&#39;s is letting you change all of the icons at once. But anyway, Apple&#39;s also\nredesigned the Control Center to be fully customizable\nacross multiple pages. So again, there&#39;s a\nlot more going on here, and there are many more customizable shortcuts in more places, including finally replacing\nthe flashlight and camera on the home screen without\njail breaking, finally. And the list keeps going. Stop me if you&#39;ve heard these before, but you can do hidden apps\nnow inside your app drawer. So you can lock apps into a hidden folder that makes it easier than ever to hide Tinder from your wife. There&#39;s also scheduled\ntext messages in iMessage. Great, finally, they&#39;re\nhaving some fun over there. There&#39;s also text formatting. There&#39;s messages via satellite. RCS support was very casually\nbut briefly mentioned. The Photos app is redesigned. There&#39;s also a game mode that now minimizes background activity and minimizes Bluetooth\nlatency for peripherals. Great. And a new automatic categorization\nin the new Mail app. So you can tell, there&#39;s\nbeen a whole bunch of stuff. I will definitely be doing a larger, more focused just iOS 18 video, so you can see everything that&#39;s new. There&#39;s plenty of little stuff that didn&#39;t make it into the keynote, so I&#39;ll do a whole deep\ndive just for that. Make sure you subscribe to be\namong the first to see that. I believe we are catching\nup to Apple in subscribers. It&#39;d be kind of nice if we pass them. That&#39;d be sick. So then AirPods got minor updates, like voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and the ability to respond to a prompt just by nodding or shaking your head, taken right from the Sony headphones. I kinda like it though, controlling it without\nusing your voice is nice. Then Apple TV gets this new feature where you swipe down on the remote at any point during a show, and it just shows you all the actors and character names of\nthe people on the screen and any song that&#39;s playing\nin that moment in real time. And there&#39;s also a feature\nthat boosts people&#39;s voices so you can always hear\nthem over the music. And then watchOS, they got\nthis little training mode that sort of balances the trends\nin your training over time and evaluates how hard a workout was versus how hard it could have been. And then iPadOS. So this was supposed to\nbe Apple&#39;s big chance to really convince us that the iPad, it&#39;s something special that&#39;s\ngot a little something to it that would make us convinced that we&#39;d wanna get the newest one, the M4 one that just came out over just your phone or over a Mac. And I&#39;ll say it did get\none incredible feature, but it didn&#39;t really\ndo much more than that. So the iPad it, it gets all the stuff I talked about with the iPhone, right? Full home screen customization, customizable Control Center, the new Photos app, et cetera. It&#39;s all great. There&#39;s also a feature in SharePlay that lets you go in and actually remotely control someone&#39;s\niPad when they allow it, which seems like a small thing, but I promise you that is\nmassive for family tech support. You know who you are. But the one massive actually\nimpressive new feature on the iPad in iPadOS 18, and you think I&#39;m joking, but I&#39;m dead serious when I say this. It&#39;s the Calculator app. It&#39;s the new calculator. I promise you I was so\nready to dunk on this. I had a tweet drafted up as\nthey were talking about it. We finally brought the\ncalculator to the iPad, and there were screenshots of it, and it looked just like the iPhone app. And I was like, &quot;Really? This is what you were so hyped about?&quot; I had that clip queued up ready of Craig Federighi being like, &quot;Yes, we had to do something super special to finally bring that\ncalculator to the iPad.&quot; But then they pulled the\nApple pencil off the side and they pulled up\nwhat&#39;s called Math Notes, and it was pretty sick. So now, on the iPad, you\ncan actually write down equations in handwriting, and it will understand what you wrote, and it&#39;ll answer the question\nand in your handwriting. And then if you adjust the equation or add new information or something, it automatically updates the answer, which was so sick. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m\nso impressed with this, but it was really cool\nto play with and look at. So if that wasn&#39;t impressive enough, it also supports variables. So you can have variables\nwritten all over the page. So look at this. It has G, and X, and A, and H, and then it&#39;s labeled\nY as the height here. So you can ask for an equation\nusing these variables, and it can give you an answer. And if you want, you can\ndo a y equals equation, and it&#39;ll give you a graph\nwith real time adjustment of any of the variables in your equation. I mean, I wish I was in sixth grade again, so this could be my full-time calculator. This is sick. Now, at this point in the keynote, they haven&#39;t even actually said the word AI a single time yet. I think this is pretty clearly AI. This is like handwriting recognition. This is like semantic understanding of all the things happening on the page. It&#39;s good AI. Well played, Craig, you did it, okay, but this is before the actual AI section. But also this wasn&#39;t mentioned on stage, but this is also coming to the iPhone&#39;s Calculator app as well. But then Mac OS. Mac OS has its newest version. It&#39;s called Sequoia, and it does also get a nice\nlittle grab bag of new features. There&#39;s automatic window\nsnapping now finally built in. You don&#39;t need a third\nparty app to do it anymore. Sherlocked. There&#39;s built in backgrounds for any app that uses the webcam feed. There&#39;s also a new password\napp that basically just takes what was buried in the settings before and just makes it its own standalone app. So it&#39;s actually on Mac,\niPad, and the iPhone. But probably the biggest\nthing is iPhone Mirroring. So this is another continuity feature that basically just lets you wirelessly always see\nyour iPhone on your Mac. It merges your notifications\nand audio with your Mac and lets you drag and\ndrop things back and forth between your phone that&#39;s\nsitting next to you and your Mac. I kinda wonder if this\nhits your phone battery harder than normal. They didn&#39;t really say, obviously, so I&#39;m gonna have to test this. But I imagine if you&#39;re just\nsitting on a wireless charger, then it won&#39;t matter. But I&#39;ll be checking that out. But then we arrived. They did all the sections with all the other operating systems, and now we got to the part where Apple&#39;s gonna talk\nabout AI stuff, kind of. Now, I don&#39;t know if you remember this, but a couple months\nago, not that long ago, I did an entire video\non all of these phrases that it seems like Apple\nrefused to say on stage. They just would not say &#39;em, and AI is one of them. They just didn&#39;t say it. They&#39;d say anything else,\nneural nets, machine learning, all sorts of other things like that, But the times of the times, people wanna hear Apple talk about AI. So they finally did. And they also, like I said, they rebranded it just for themselves to just commander the AI name. And so now it&#39;s called Apple\nIntelligence in Apple Land. So here&#39;s basically what you need to know about Apple Intelligence, right? So Apple has already had AI features on their devices before. They&#39;ve had the Neural\nEngine inside of their chips, and they&#39;ve done things like, smartly cutting subjects out of photos. They&#39;ve done things like auto\ncomplete on the keyboard. That&#39;s already existed. But this new Apple Intelligence is basically a bucket of\nthese new generative models and what they do on your devices. So there&#39;s these new diffusion models, generative models, and\nlarge language models that are all built by Apple that bring new functionality\nto the supported devices. And actually, I&#39;ll just\nget that out the way, right off the bat. These are only supported on the highest end versions of currently available Apple silicon. So that just means iPhone 15 Pro and any iPad with M1 or later and any Mac with M1 or later. So what does that look like? Well, basically starting\nwith these new OSs, there&#39;s a small suite of tools that&#39;s kind of sprinkled\nacross everything. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s one Apple Intelligence app\nor something like that. They&#39;re just kind of sprinkled throughout. So here&#39;s an example, writing tools. We all know how powerful these\nlarge language models can be. So anytime you&#39;re writing\nin pages or keynote or basically anywhere\nwhere there&#39;s a cursor, you can use the writing tools to summarize or rewrite something that\nyou&#39;ve already written. It can change the writing\nstyle or just proofread, just basic useful stuff. Here&#39;s another one. Remember the Magic Eraser\ntool in Google Photos and these Android phones that use it? Apple&#39;s finally doing that too. Built into their own Photos\nApp is a Clean Up tool, and it&#39;s basically the same idea. This will identify background items. It&#39;ll let you circle items\nyou don&#39;t like in your photos and just get rid of them. Fill in the background with\ngenerative fill, super quick. And there&#39;s also Genmojis,\ngenerative emojis. And this made me feel really old &#39;cause I would never use this, but apparently there&#39;s\na whole group of people who go through searching for emojis and then they find that\nthere&#39;s one that doesn&#39;t exist, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Dang, I\nwish I could just make an emoji for this moment right now.&quot; And for those people, yeah, now you can. You can generate a new emoji, You can literally type\nit in like a prompt, and the diffusion model will create that new emoji from scratch in the style of all the other emojis. And they had an entire thing\ncalled the Image Playground that&#39;s built into a bunch of Apples apps, but also has its own separate app that lets you create these\nnice little square images with prompts in three different styles, sketch, illustration, and animation. And yes, there are also Siri improvements that&#39;s using the large language models to generally understand context better and just generally be\nbetter and more natural at being an assistant that isn&#39;t garbage. And later in the year,\nit will also be able to pull info from inside of apps and take actions inside\nof apps for you too. I remember when this\nwas a huge Bixby feature on Samsung phones. So that&#39;s cool to see. Plus there&#39;s also this big pretty new full-screen animation when\nyou&#39;re triggering Siri to tie it all together. Its voice is apparently slightly updated and you can now also type to Siri instead of talking to\nit out loud every time, which is long overdue, but also nice. There is notes app summaries, there is phone call summaries, just all kinds of features\nsprinkled around like I said. I think I&#39;ll end up making a video just summarizing or testing or reviewing all of the Apple Intelligence stuff &#39;cause it&#39;s kind of all over the place, but now you know what it&#39;s. But one question that&#39;s been floating around the internet is, what stuff is happening on device versus things that have\nto go to the cloud? And this has also come up a lot because you might have\nalso heard about Apple partnering specifically with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-4.0 into\nthis Apple Intelligence stuff. So it&#39;s a big question\neveryone&#39;s wondering. So I got the official answers from Apple, and the answer is basically almost everything happens\non device intentionally, and those are from Apple built models, so that should be the\nfastest stuff that happens. But in the chance that there\nare things that are too complex or just outside of the area of\nexpertise of Apple&#39;s models, then it can basically go one of two ways. One is it will go to a\nlarger server based model that&#39;s on servers that Apple has built with Apple silicon using what they call\nPrivate Cloud Compute. So basically the info is\nnever stored or sent to Apple. It&#39;s still gonna have the downsides of having to go off of the\ndevice up to the cloud. It might take a bit longer if you&#39;re in an area\nwith terrible internet. It might not work at all, but in the chance that this\nis like a big complex thing that could benefit from those models, that&#39;s what it&#39;ll try to do. But the other is when you\nspecifically ask it for something that ChatGPT would be good at. And if that happens, then it\nwill specifically ask you, &quot;Hey, is it cool if I ask chat GPT for an answer to this question?&quot; And then you can give it\na yes or no on the spot. So anytime it wants to do this, whether it&#39;s to upload a photo that you&#39;re asking something about or just do a complex prompt in general, then this little dialogue box pops up and you have to say yes every time, and then you can tap into everything that OpenAI&#39;s model is capable of, or generate even more realistic or varied, random different styles of images that Apple&#39;s diffusion\nmodels would never make. This is all free without an account. At no point is OpenAI allowed to ever store any of these requests, and Apple has also said that they will obscure your IP address. So you can&#39;t even... OpenAI can&#39;t even connect\nmultiple requests together to form a profile of you. There&#39;s just a lot of\nthought that&#39;s gone into ideally making this as secure\nand private of a version of going to the cloud for AI\nfeatures as they possibly can. So yeah, it&#39;s really interesting, a lot of interesting stuff going on here. I think my overall take with a lot of this WWDC announcements and with the Apple Intelligence stuff, first of all, is that the\nHumane Pin and the Rabbit R1, they were so doomed from the start. Even if they were good up to this point, there&#39;s just no way\nthey could be as good as this stuff on your phone\nwith all the personalization, all the info that they\nalready know about you. So I guess that&#39;s confirmed, but also it does feel like we&#39;ve entered a new age with Apple. I think the AI stuff is so\nimportant that it very much is what we&#39;re most interested\nin and it overshadows. Honestly, what could\npossibly be your favorite non-AI feature from\nthe past couple things? Moving home screen apps\nand icons everywhere, that might be the biggest thing, but it&#39;s up to this point now all about what this intelligence stuff\ncan actually do for you and what it can bring you. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m really excited about. I&#39;ll be working on some videos very soon about a lot of this stuff. So definitely, like I said, get subscribed if you haven&#39;t already, but this has been your overview\nor what you need to know. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (gentle music)"
