      "subtitles": "looking for a game that doesn&#39;t last you a bajillion hours something a little bit smaller scale not a massive open world but just a good linear Adventure well today we&#39;re talking about 20 linear single player games from throughout 20204 new and upcoming we got a bunch of games so let&#39;s just jump in with number 20 we&#39;re starting with an obvious it&#39;s the upcoming release of the Silent Hill 2 remake if you know anything about Silent Hill it&#39;s it&#39;s a survival horror game and with that comes a fair amount of linearity sure you can wander the foggy streets of Silent Hill but ultimately if it&#39;s anything like the original game it&#39;s a fairly linear Adventure at the time of making this video we still haven&#39;t seen this game we&#39;re really hoping for the best because we love classic Silent Hill hopefully they don&#39;t screw it up here but if they do nail it if they do knock it out of the park and successfully remake this original game chances are you&#39;ll have a good solid linear adventure to play through from beginning to end it&#39;s over you&#39;re not doing endless side quests that&#39;s it it&#39;s just cool again I&#39;m still not sure about this one but I really hope blubber team knocks it out of the park next over at number 19 we have children of the sun this is a devolver digital published game and from that you should know it&#39;s something different it&#39;s something unique it&#39;s a sniping game it&#39;s all about running around the outside of your enemy camp finding the perfect angle and taking the shot on your enemies here it&#39;s all about Flawless execution but there&#39;s really fun mechanics added like how you can control the bullet essentially it&#39;s it&#39;s more of a puzzle game than a shooter but it&#39;s got a lot of style and it&#39;s really cool and it&#39;s essentially structured in levels so it&#39;s a linear thing you play through but if you grew up playing games where you would choose the sniper rifle or maybe you played the silent scope games children of the sun is a really different Unique Kind of Indie style artsy spin on those Concepts and because of that it&#39;s absolutely awesome next over at number 18 we have black myth Wukong I will chalk this one up on the list of sort of kind of linear either way black myth Wukong is an absolutely fantastic action adventure game with cool combat really really compelling boss battles and an incredible visual style it&#39;s also a very straightforward game it is level based you play through a level you finish it you move on to the next area so that by definition is linear most of the time Blackmouth Wukong definitely opens up after about the third act and these levels go from tight Corridor hallway levels you know glorified worlds to absolutely massive more expansive explorable areas still there are diversions in these areas there are optional bosses and stuff like that it&#39;s still in my mind a linear game either way it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s absolutely an awesome one next over at number 17 we have Neva this is the next game from the people behind Gris a really interesting simple 2D Adventure that had beautiful art and music uh neeva seems to be taking it a step further add in combat an animal combat that seemingly grows with you along the adventure and is probably all going to make us cry at one point we don&#39;t know how open this game is it does seem from previews that it is going to be a fairly linear Adventure you just play through and finish and that&#39;s refreshing well know for sure when never releases October 15th next over at number 16 we have kitsugi path of the Goddess now if you like Capcom games I&#39;d say definitely take a peek at this one because they did something totally different instead of doing another big expansive big budget game kugami path of the Goddess is kind of a tower defense game there&#39;s a lot more to it than that like you have more agency as a player and as a character but it&#39;s just really unique surprisingly addictive and fun along with that you&#39;re playing through levels it&#39;s not a massive expansive thing it&#39;s just a good straightforward Adventure that can sometimes get pretty challenging as well next over at number 15 we have Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 HD uh this released for Nintendo switch earlier this year and it&#39;s a re-release of an incredible game Luigi&#39;s Mansion games are really really underrated by some they&#39;re just a blast and Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 continues that granted it is a HD re-release of a game from a handheld platform so there are some shortcomings but this more than any game on the list is just a good oldfashioned video game now next over at number 14 uh if we are are talking about Good oldfashioned video games we have to mention astrobot astrobot is a platformer where you jump into levels and you play through those levels and finish them in a linear fashion granted you do have some Choice as to which planet or which level you engage in you know it&#39;s up to you in terms of like what order you want to tackle all these levels But ultimately the game is structured in kind of like little nebulas where you go through you clear out all the planets you fight the boss then you move on to the next cluster of planets and we think it&#39;s one of the more fun simple Charming games released this year next over at number 13 we have Indiana Jones and the great circle this is by machine games the people behind the Wolfenstein games which are very very linear and they&#39;ve been upfront about Indiana Jones being a pretty linear experience as well there&#39;s going to be some Hub areas and some semi explorable areas but ultimately you&#39;re going through an Indiana Jones video game Adventure I really hope they nail this one because there was a time when Indiana Jones had a bunch of cool video games so I hope we can go back to that time if anything this kind of reminds me of Chronicles of Ric escape from butcher Bay that&#39;s kind of a deep cut but some of you older players will definitely know what I&#39;m talking about some of the people involved were involved in that game and this could be potentially very cool and very good for Indiana Jones fans next over at number 12 we have Indica which is a really really fascinating Adventure so you play as a nun in a kind of alternate industrialist Russia timeline and and you essentially Venture through a spooky Frozen land there&#39;s a lot more to it than that there&#39;s some story here and it&#39;s kind of like a mix between like a simple adventure maybe borderline walking simulator with some good shakeups as well as puzzle solving because Indica is cursed with kind of having a literal devil on her shoulder meaning she was kind of shunned by her convin and given a mission to go out into the world it it&#39;s so weird and quirky it&#39;s incredibly unique from the presentation to just the setup and it&#39;s not an open World adventure that&#39;s going to take you 80 hours next over at number 11 we have another remake it&#39;s it&#39;s the brothers A Tale of Two Sons uh this game from Haz light the people behind uh it takes two you know the game of the year winner from a few years back uh this is kind of like their humble beginnings where you play as two brothers you control both of them uh with the joysticks on your controller and it&#39;s a really good game I think because it doesn&#39;t outstay it&#39;s welcome you can finish it in like 3 4 hours and it&#39;s just like a well-crafted well-paced thing the re-release this year didn&#39;t get a ton of traction online but we&#39;re glad the game is available for modern platforms it&#39;s it&#39;s a really cool linear game to play through next over at number 10 we have Call of Duty Black Ops 6 specifically the campaign while you&#39;re probably going to have some degree of freedom in terms of choosing what to encounter next it&#39;s a first-person shooter campaign so by definition it&#39;s probably going to be fairly linear but we&#39;re really looking forward to it the Black Ops campaigns when they have campaigns uh definitely deliver they go a little bit more experimental a little bit stranger and we think that this one is probably going to continue that Trend the Cold War campaign did some really interesting things and we&#39;re hoping to see that continued here next over at number nine we have a quiet place the road ahead we don&#39;t have movie time in games as often as we used to and now a lot of the times when they release they&#39;re actually pretty decent and with a quiet place the road ahead it&#39;s being published by saber interactive who&#39;ve had a couple of good hits lately I think they know what they&#39;re doing most of the time and this is a firsters Adventure in the world of the quiet place it&#39;s a Survivor game you&#39;re trying to survive in a world invaded by deadly other worldly creatures that are attracted to sound so from what we can see here it seems like you&#39;re using a lot of the tricks from the movies to stay silent to get around safely it&#39;s not about killing these monsters it&#39;s about sneaking around them it&#39;s about finding objects and tricks in the environment to outwit and adapt and survive I don&#39;t know I hope it&#39;s really good I think quiet place is a really good interesting franchise and a video game version could be pretty cool and really help establish a little bit more of this post-apocalyptic World we&#39;ll know for sure when it releases October 17th next over at number eight we have still wakes the Deep this is a first-person Adventure that takes place on an oil rig in Scotland in the 70s a very unique setting for a very cool weird strange horror game you have some agency as a player but I would say gameplay-wise it&#39;s pretty straightforward it&#39;s called by the develop an immersive disaster story it&#39;s hard not to talk about this one without spoiling anything but it is an incredibly unique and creepy experience I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely different from other things you&#39;ve played this year and certainly one of the more unique horror experiences on this list it&#39;s linear it&#39;s straightforward it&#39;s pretty linear there are some distractions but really you can finish it in like four or five hours next over at number seven we have the recently released Plucky Squire a creative spin on Adventure platforming thanks to its art style its visual style the way it genuinely feels here like these 2D fun quirky story but characters can jump out of that book and continue adventuring it&#39;s a really really cool idea and it seems to be resonating with people especially if you&#39;re still in touch with your inner child uh here it&#39;s a pretty linear game you progress through and while there are some secret paths and stuff like that it could take you probably like 7 8 9 hours next over at number six we have the until da on remake this game is completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 it&#39;s a game I really really enjoyed upon release I actually remember doing the before you buy for it way back when I&#39;m like a 100 years old now but it&#39;s a game that I never expected to see a remake but here we are it&#39;s got support for modern features obviously better visuals and it&#39;s just a really good fun horror Adventure that wears its influences on its sleeves it is all about Choice it is all about timing these events but still it is like a playable movie you progress through so yeah I&#39;d say it&#39;s linear I don&#39;t know how the Remake will turn out but either way until dawn is worth playing we&#39;ll know whether or not the Remake is good when it releases October 4th of this year next over at number five speaking of remakes we have the Dead Rising Deluxe remaster now this one in terms of being a linear game is a little tricky I might be cheating here because it has a fully explorable mall with main missions side missions but the whole thing is structured around a deadline you have 72 hours in this mall to explore its Secrets save as many survivors as you can tackle sub objectives and optional bosses and uh yeah man it&#39;s really cool the Remake definitely has some issues I pointed them out in my before you bu if you&#39;re a Die Hard fan you might have some nitpicks but either way Dead Rising is just a game worth playing in general and yeah I&#39;ll say that having that 72-hour deadline having a time limit to you finishing everything because you need to get on the hel op to escape sort of it&#39;s just a really cool unique straightforward structure to a zombie game that you wouldn&#39;t really expect now next over at number four we&#39;re sticking with horror with alone in the dark yes the alone inth dark reboot or whatever you want to call it did release earlier this year it&#39;s kind of like a new creative imagining of the original game set into duretto mansion with Edward kby and unfortunately it does fall a little short it has a lot of creative elements and some cool level design But ultimately I was a bit mixed on it when it released still though it felt refreshing because it was just like a regular old school kind of survival horror game you just play through and finish there are two campaigns technically you can play as the two main characters you know kind of like a Leon and CLA situation definitely not as good the game definitely has some issues but if you&#39;re just looking for something a little bit different and just like a regular old horror Adventure in a spooky Mansion well alone in the dark&#39;s got you covered for that at least maybe if you get it on sale next over at number three we have hellblade 2 senua saga this is a really really linear game and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as the original hellblade I&#39;ll say that but if you are looking for an adventure to just get whisked away in and kind of turn off your brain a little bit uh the hellblade 2 is definitely good for that because it is so tightly linear there&#39;s not really an exploration you&#39;re constantly just pushing forward and it certainly has its flaws but it is still a beautiful Adventure with some really cool memorable moments it&#39;s also gory creepy and kind of weird which I certainly don&#39;t think is a bad thing next down at number two we have something really unique with tactical breach Wizards this recently released game is kind of like a uh XCOM where your fantasy wizards but don&#39;t worry it&#39;s actually kind of badass it&#39;s way cooler than you&#39;d think uh you&#39;re busting into places and taking out enemies in that XCOM turn-based strategy style you&#39;re using cover you&#39;re using the environment you&#39;re using your teammates all to outwit and defeat these enemies and it&#39;s cool as hell it&#39;s got a little bit of a stylized art style a little cartoony but it really can hit the turnbas tactics thing is always really fun and this is level based so you&#39;re playing through it you&#39;re having a good time it&#39;ll take you about 13 14 hours now down at number one we have Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 the single player campaign for this game is completely linear you play through an adventure as Demitri and Titus doing his Space Marine thing and it&#39;s cool as hell it definitely helps if you played the original game but either way this is a good fun adventure it gets a little zany gets a little video gamey towards the end but it&#39;s a good linear adventure with spectacle challenge some cool bosses and good pacing one moment you&#39;re fighting hordes and hordes of enemies in a massive open Battlefield and then the next you regrouping with your teammates back at base and then the next moment uh you&#39;re walking through creepy pitch black hallway is waiting for an enemy to strike there&#39;s just a lot of really good moments here and it&#39;s a ton of fun you can finish it anywhere from like 8 to 10 hours and it&#39;s cool as hell it&#39;s gotten a lot of people into Warhammer 40K and for good reason this is just a straight regular oldfashioned linear video game campaign granted there&#39;s all multiplayer and all that cool stuff but for the sake of this video yeah it&#39;s the campaign baby those are 20 linear or linear is single player games that we wanted to talk about today for 2024 I know there are more we couldn&#39;t squeeze them all in this list so we&#39;d love love to hear from you in the comments anything in particular you got something you want to talk about let us know what you&#39;re thinking let us know if you enjoyed these games or if you&#39;re playing any of them or looking forward to them clicking the like button helps us out cuz we put out videos every single day but as always thanks for watching and we&#39;ll see you guys next time"

      "subtitles": "some other guy has got something better than you just the facts of life right well some of us who play games get fairly green eyes fairly often hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 10 things that make every gamer jealous at number 10 is a kick-ass console or PC setup of course obviously the most basic dream of all Gamers to have the perfect space to do all your gaming you got a big TV bunch of monitors on your PC a big comfy PC chair all the purple gamer lights a Wann toe streamer could ever want blah blah blah there are some amazing setups online they&#39;re not hard to find there&#39;s an entire Reddit dedicated to this stuff actually multiple reddits they&#39;re pretty much the ubiquitous gamer dream we all want a big space lots of room for the consoles the PC equipment but it&#39;s a dream only a select few of us are actually capable of achieving the biggest issue is of course space most of us just game in the living room or our bedrooms but if you want the ultimate setup you&#39;re going to need a dedicated space for it especially if you&#39;re sharing the house with people who aren&#39;t into the IDE of covering walls with monitors and erecting giant shelves full of gaming detrus you need room for an office or a basement which means you need a big house or an apartment with a spare room in it which isn&#39;t exactly an achievable goal for everyone out there even if you do have the space actually going out and creating the perfect gamer cave isn&#39;t always easyier straightforward either it&#39;s a lot of work setting up and programming all those LEDs well it&#39;s actually supposedly relatively easy but that doesn&#39;t stop me from not knowing how to do it and it requires a level of dedication not only to learn but to execute and it&#39;s beyond dragging a couch into a room and buying a $100 TV off Amazon and once you get all of this stuff in your head and you&#39;re thinking about it like ah this would be good stuff there&#39;s always that guy you know who&#39;s already got it you&#39;ve been over to their house a bunch of times might be a guy might be girl I don&#39;t know but they got everything except for the simmering rage boiling up within you as you become increasingly Green With Envy they don&#39;t have that you have that they have all the stuff you want and number and uh I don&#39;t know this one might come off a little bit harsh but uh having a stable job in your 30s so you can actually afford games and buy everything you want remember when you were a kid and you had no money sure you might had free time but without that cold Hard Cash your gaming prospects were pretty limited you were stuck scrounging for cash doing odd jobs for elderly neighbors you know mowing grass raking leaves and of course the worst um printer stuff you skip lunch you save up lunch money and you sell off old games for pennies on the dollar so you can afford the next big game maybe that was your past maybe it&#39;s your present either way it sucks gaming is an expensive Hobby and sure there are ways around it now we&#39;ve got Game Pass and all those free games on the Epic store but some games are going to come around uh you just got to have right now there&#39;s no waiting for a sale it&#39;s not going to ever go on Game Pass it&#39;s R mature so your parents aren&#39;t going to buy for birthday or or let&#39;s say you&#39;re an adult and you just don&#39;t have any money not great going through all this turmoil to get a game is exhausting and and you got to be selective you can&#39;t just get anything you want you got to pin your hopes on one big purchase one special Hail Mary of Miracle Prayer then you find you just blew 60 bucks on a pile of crap that could have gone to something better Lord knows there&#39;s plenty of that nowadays hell7 $80 having no money is stressful that&#39;s why when we were all kids we were jealous of adult Gamers who could just buy whatever they wanted without a care that and the economy was a hell of a lot better back then I grew up in the&#39;80s and &#39;90s everybody&#39;s flushed with cash compared to now like there&#39;s a lot of people now that are of the age that they should be getting anything they want with their you know gainful employment but they&#39;re driving Uber and selling carpets and they&#39;re just not making any money it&#39;s hard out on them streets you know the joy of being an adult with an actually decent paying job is I mean just so much stress is gone I mean this all only applies if the adult in question isn&#39;t married or has major obligations like child support or an aging relative or a caretaker someone with disability all that adult money just goes right out the window trust me on that one for the few of us that are lucky to have money that we can just spend on games you got to try to remember what it was like when you were that kid or when you were poor like 3 or 4 years ago appreciate what you&#39;ve got man cuz it makes everybody else jealous moving on to number eight a uh massive inhome arcade this one is those ones that like maybe it&#39;s not practical maybe you don&#39;t need it but don&#39;t tell me that hasn&#39;t been a dream of yours at some point especially if you grew up in a certain era the era that I stated that I grew up in uh there&#39;s this nostalgic appeal of the arcade that cannot be overstated the dim lights the Disco Balls the squiggly pattern carpets the constant hum of screens trying to catch your attention and slices of pizza that cost way more than any slice of pizza ever had business costing our kids just really have this special place in many um I hate to say Elder Gamers Hearts but uh I guess that&#39;s the case a big part of what made them so special were the games that you could play in the arcades there were home versions of games they were usually inferior now as the years went on and consoles got better arcade games and their home ports were pretty much the same but there was something special about playing them on a proper arcade cabin like I I remember Street Fighter back in the day yeah I loved it on Super Nintendo but man going in the arcade and playing it where the Sprites were bigger and the sound was better and seemed more responsive and Super Nintendo was uh it could be fast but um Street Fighter 2 in the in the arcade was badass man and when you&#39;re a kid actually owning an arcade cabinet just one felt like an impossible dream it would take Richie Rich money blank check money to do that these days we know that arcade cabinets aren&#39;t really that expensive your classic cabinet sells for around 2,000 or 2500 bucks these days which is a lot of money but uh it&#39;s not like $2,000 or $2,500 back when arcades were a thing before you know 30 years of inflation I mean owning a cabinet isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility for a lot of people uh but owning an entire collection of them that is it&#39;s out of it&#39;s it&#39;s out of the question I&#39;m not buying an arcade cabinet anytime soon I&#39;ll tell you that that&#39;s a lot of money that frankly I don&#39;t have so when you see these things about people who build an entire arcade in their home it&#39;s hard not to be jealous just having all those big boxes all to yourself getting the Vibes of the arcade without the Bo and the beer stick H that would be great you need a big house to pull it off which is I mean kind of makes sense cuz you&#39;re buying like multiple $2,500 things just to have around the old 1,800 Square footer ain&#39;t going to do that not if you got kids or a partner or roommates or or whatever like can you honestly imagine having like 10 or 20 or 30 arcade games in your house that&#39;s like tens of thousands of dollars I&#39;m not going to do the math but that&#39;s a lot of money it&#39;s something that most gamers are never going to be able to see and also maybe even just willing to spend the money on something that is ultimately pretty frivolous there is a hidden cost as well you&#39;re not just building an arcade you have to maintain it as well a lot of these old arcade games are well old and require repairs it&#39;s kind of like most of those like Golden Era games or CRTs as well which are notoriously difficult to repair and should really only be attempted by professionals like messing with a CRT is honestly dangerous the shock from them can be fatal working on an arcade cabinet isn&#39;t just something any casual Enthusiast can just do so that&#39;s another massive expense combined with a lot of potential headaches there so yeah owning an in-house arcade probably more of a pain in the ass than it&#39;s worth at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m telling myself moving on to number 7 it&#39;s gigantic game collection if you&#39;ve seen any video game channel on YouTube with some kind of retr focus you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about the giant wall of games in the background shelves on top of shelves of every possible game imaginable these guys have done it they have the gigantic game collection TM they&#39;ve got complete console collections they&#39;ve got the rarest and most obscure games they&#39;ve got easy access to all of them if you got any kind of collector&#39;s mindset it&#39;s hard not to be jealous of these dragons hordes of games cuz building a collection like that is not easy or cheap especially anymore like if you&#39;re getting into game collecting now you&#39;re going to be envious of the people who got their foot in the door early or rather should I say bought video game systems and games when they were one generation obsolete during the 9s and early 2000s like seriously you could get NES and SNES and Genesis and PlayStation one you could get it all dirt cheap back then it was common to find the stuff getting sold for pennies at like local game stores or swap meets or the more enterprising Among Us got to Craigslist first also uh also I want to note I saw a comment on a recent video saying that you guys think I&#39;m 50 based on the cultural stuff I grew up in the &#39; 80s and &#39;90s I&#39;m not 50 I&#39;m 40 I keep saying I&#39;m old but I mean in gamer years and when I get to 50 it&#39;s going to be the new 30 okay let&#39;s back off that a bit guys but yeah talking about the passage of time everything is expensive you might get lucky once in a while using Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist which is actually still around something like that there&#39;s other things too like there&#39;s local ones for various cities and municipalities but in general retro game prices of Skyrock rocketed so building a proper collection is going to be a costly and frustrating Endeavor it&#39;s kind of morbid but we kind of have to wait for the big time collectors to croak so all their games flood the market maybe then collecting games will be a little cheaper again even if you know that&#39;s more of me trying to logic out a way for Game Collection to become cheaper again I don&#39;t think that will actually make it cheaper now that I think about it and number six the lucky ones who play a game at the height of its popularity finally something that&#39;s not at entirely money related obviously when you buy a brand new game that&#39;s probably when it&#39;s most likely to be popular and it costs more then but let&#39;s put that aside if you&#39;re into multiplayer games or MMOs or online games of any type the specific type of jealousy is definitely hit you once or twice it really sucks when you hear like a ton about a game and you don&#39;t have the money uh or proper rig to buy it at the time so you have to wait all you can do is read about the cool stuff going on in the game and it only gets you more hype to finally jump in but when you do the ser servers are a ghost town only most hardcore players are still around and want nothing to do with you and all your friends have already moved on anyone who gets to a game on the tail end of its popularity knows this phenomenon well the problem with online games is they are not Eternal they&#39;re entirely dependent around the community around them and once that Community is gone there&#39;s not really anything left to keep it going like somebody who&#39;s read all those exciting stories about Eve online about the massive Wars between huge corporations all the politics and scheming going on behind the scenes they&#39;re going to be kind of disappointed with the game now it&#39;s not dead but it&#39;s definitely not as active as it was in its Heyday The Glory Days are behind us and anyone who starts playing now is going to feel that Pang of Envy when they read about the Epic clashes that went down in the game in the past so many MMOs that are still around in some form had thriving communities in the past but are now just a shadow of their former selves you can still play them of course but the social experience is just entirely different instead of enjoying the game as it was meant to be played with an Engaged friend group you&#39;re just wandering around solo well Bots spam the general chat there&#39;s few desperate stragglers around trying to show they&#39;re epen but that really doesn&#39;t do anything but make you seem like you got no real peen there&#39;s just no turning back the hands of time you&#39;ll never be able to relive The Glory Days and for those of us that missed out it&#39;s it&#39;s hard not to be jealous of the people who were there for the good times number five is when you have the free time to actually clear out your backlog being an adult isn&#39;t all sunshine and rainbows it&#39;s awesome to wake up and realize oh man I just buy stuff I want I&#39;m not dirt poor anymore or at least I&#39;m not as dirt poor as I was it&#39;s easy to get Gams and with the Advent of steam sales and humble bundles and epic giveaways and just straight up free games it&#39;s pretty easy to build up collection of digital games nowadays having all that stuff is easy actually playing it isn&#39;t when we were kids it sounded like the best problem to have oh yeah I got too many games ah dang what am I ever going to do ah but what started out as a funny thing to complain about has evolved into a problem that legitimately stresses a lot lot of people out H backlog doesn&#39;t necessarily mean games you&#39;ve bought so this isn&#39;t necessarily a money one yeah it&#39;s a very minor problem my backlog is too big that&#39;s kind of lame to complain about but uh some people struggle to finish games they can&#39;t focus on a single thing or once their brains are too fried after a long day of work for instance to concentrate on playing something that&#39;s you know mentally demanding we want to play all the games we own but we don&#39;t have the time or Focus to do it and let&#39;s face it they&#39;ve created a situation that is kind of like the subscription problem where you got 500 subscriptions to 500 different streaming services the more of them you have it seems like the less likely you are to watch anything on any of them yeah it&#39;s just like that but with games at a certain point you&#39;re going to look at people with small or no backlogs with some degree of jealousy you&#39;re going to be envious of people who retired early or got a massive inheritance and don&#39;t need to work a day in their lives or just more uh basically they don&#39;t have to work long hours or have a lot of commitments pour one out for the adult gamer with kids it&#39;s easier as they get older but the gaming time is it&#39;s never going to be the same as somebody who gets a pretty fair amount of time for gaming as it is essentially my job I do not have a cleared backlog and if somebody whose job is to play video games and talk about it observe report Etc if we can&#39;t clear out a log I don&#39;t know who really can like it it&#39;s got to be somebody who doesn&#39;t have to work at all like you play games for a job you still have to do the job part if you play games because you don&#39;t need a job it&#39;s just the game part I&#39;m jealous of that I&#39;m sure you&#39;re jealous of me because I get to play games for a living but it&#39;s not all just that aspect like there&#39;s a lot of other things that go into this but believe me I sympathize I haven&#39;t always been this fortunate and I will again thank you all for the ability to do this as a job you are fantastic people don&#39;t eat me Falcon is it&#39;s a it&#39;s not as good as chicken I promise I don&#39;t don&#39;t ask how I know that and number four is skilled PC Builders and electrical engineers who can easily fix things if you&#39;re not the technically inclined type it&#39;s inevitable you&#39;re going to be jealous of the gamers who are capable of making their own repairs no matter what kind of electronics you own repairs are costly and frankly infuriating you have to deal with crappy customer service you have to package things ship them it&#39;ll be gone for weeks and when it does finally come back there&#39;s no guarantee it&#39;s going to work I&#39;ve sent stuff to be repaired and it did literally nothing trying to get your stuff fixed can just be a nightmare it would be easier if you could just fix it yourself right you could troubleshoot you crack open cases with and have the proper tools know what the proper tools even are you could open things up without breaking anything you can check traces repair connections you could use a so so soldering a soldering iron it&#39;s that&#39;s how to say it right I know it&#39;s not soldiering iron it better not be and let&#39;s not talk about multimeters I I don&#39;t know what their use is even forget schematics I&#39;m not there I can you know kind of work on stuff but there&#39;s a pretty nonzero chance I will break the thing that I am trying to fix so I don&#39;t just being able to do something like repair stick drift on a switch with a simple mod that would be a nice skill to have that&#39;s a little lower level right but some people seem to just be able to do anything I&#39;ve seen this guy who&#39;s into repairing old PCS and he was able to build a new PCI card from scratch he sourced all the capacitors and the chips reverse engineered the entire thing created a blueprint and had a company print the boards out for them I don&#39;t need that I I would like basic repair skills I mean at least it&#39;s easier to do stuff like that with YouTube tutorials having a video to work off of when you&#39;re repairing something it&#39;s definitely helpful I&#39;ve replaced a few batteries that uh I shouldn&#39;t have any business doing anything like that thanks to YouTube videos but uh yeah I&#39;ll admit it I&#39;m a little jealous of the guys that make those videos because uh they know all of that stuff and number three having these skill s and patience to turn your dream game into reality everyone wants to be a game designer I have tried many times to learn I&#39;ve put lots of effort into it probably the amount of effort that somebody who gets it would need to put into it in order to do it but to make a game you need a programmer you need artist you need musician and if you&#39;re going to do all of that yourself like a number of indie game makers have done in recent years people have become very very wealthy like the undertale guy he&#39;s all things just one of those things is Out Of Reach for most of us let alone all three making games is hard as hell I bet the majority of people who play games have at least dabbled in some kind of game making tool and kicked around the idea of making a game we&#39;ve all got that dream game in our heads the culmination of all things we like in games or just that idea we think nobody&#39;s ever done before or done properly very few of us ever actually make the game though cuz seriously it&#39;s incredibly hard even people with everything working for them struggle and burn out making games so it&#39;s all the more impressive when somebody manages to make something and put it out in the world it&#39;s especially impressive when it&#39;s just like one person I mentioned uh Toby Fox the undertale guy uh but there&#39;s also like Tom Francis who made gunpoint and uh the recent and awesome tactical breach Wizards those guys were able to turn their dreams into reality not just that they actually turn their hobby into a successful career like the stardew valley guy is like tens of millions of dollars now lots of money and if he&#39;s a Savvy man he has invested and has significant ly more than we know hard not to be a little jealous of the possibilities forget the success though just making the games we&#39;re all Gamers we all want to make games it would be nice to get some recognition for a great idea you know the hard part&#39;s doing it and number two people who can read Japanese these days pretty much everything gets some kind of localization and if not some enterprising fan will do it instead but way back the only way any of us were ever going to get the chance to play untranslated games is if we could read Japanese that was the only way I remember looking on in Envy at people who got to play Demon Souls back then it was never clear if it was going to come to the US it did of course but uh let&#39;s go ahead and bring up Mother 3 right that game went untranslated for years and a dedicated fan is the one who did it Nintendo still hasn&#39;t done that some games are stuck in Japan for decades the second Ace investigations game just now got an official translation in 2024 more than 10 years after it came out in Japan it used to be Japan was kind of a mythological place full of games we just couldn&#39;t play so anyone who could actually speak the language had access to a whole lot of games we could only look at screenshots of and go H famitsu huh that&#39;s how I say it did you know that only 258 Saturn games came out in the US the Sega Saturn in Japan got roughly 1,000 more 1,265 games the vast majority of that library is Japan only and many of its more interesting games have never been translated if you&#39;re really into schms and jrpgs you&#39;re going to be jealous of people who can can actually uh speak Japanese look at me I&#39;m failing in English here and finally at number one an entire Warehouse full of sealed games there&#39;s your standard game collector we&#39;re all jealous of was talking about him a few minutes ago then there&#39;s this the true motherload an entire Warehouse full of unopened games and consoles that&#39;s a real Pie in the Sky dream right there not just a wall of games but a whole building that&#39;s just wall to--all games that are all in pristine condition remember that old game show Supermarket Suite if if you don&#39;t I don&#39;t blame you I&#39;m old I would take something like that though but for this Warehouse all I need is a shopping cart in 5 minutes and I I&#39;ll rans sack this freaking joint I guess that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s in an undisclosed location seriously they brought some YouTubers in to check it out and made them not reveal this location like it&#39;s the warehouse where they dump the Arc of the Covenant at the end of Raiders in fact if any of you ever get to go there maybe keep your eyes out I&#39;m sure that&#39;s pretty valuable I mean we&#39;re talking like Commodore 64 nonsense yeah I was wasn&#39;t kidding I said I said I was old but uh there was a place called computer reset Warehouse it was literally wall to--all old school PC stuff going way back to the even the 80s covering the whole spectrum of condition they had pallets full of stuff that was like new next to literal garbage it was a total mess but man that would have been a cool place to explore if you&#39;re a retro PC guy sure you can be jealous of people who have the resources to own a a warehouse full of stuff but my jealousy is a little more mundane I&#39;m jealous of people who are lucky enough to even check these places out I do have one bonus for you and it was probably the thing that you thought of first if you&#39;re even remotely um inclined uh but a proper gamer girlfriend Andor boyfriend just throwing this one out uh let&#39;s be real it&#39;s the ultimate source of jealousy for a lot of Gamers the dream is getting a significant other who&#39;s as into your dumb hobby as you are really that goes for any hobby but gaming is it&#39;s it&#39;s the the struggle is real let&#39;s say for many reasons it&#39;s not something that&#39;s all that common I don&#39;t want to get into a bunch of dumb gender stuff here because it never gets weird and uncomfortable men like this women like this blah blah blah blah is it nature or is it nurture it&#39;s probably nurture let&#39;s be be frank but it doesn&#39;t really matter it&#39;s a fact of life every gamer wants a gamer significant other for obvious reasons but only the lucky few really get to have one and that&#39;s all all I&#39;ve

      "subtitles": "ah franchises multiple video games and a single IP sequels we&#39;re often talking about how bad they are how they&#39;re beating a dead horse but sometimes a franchise deserves another entry hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 20 game franchises that desperately need a comeback starting off with number 20 it&#39;s Bioshock we have been hearing rumors about a potential Bioshock Revival for many many years it&#39;s the go-to prediction for wannabe leakers is stateof Play Starting or an Xbox director a cozy games conference you bet someone is going to say the next Bioshock is going to be announced so far it&#39;s just that rumors grumblings the he said she said [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah sorry my inner Fred Durst came out for a moment um yeah nothing it&#39;s a series that&#39;s way too big not to bring back eventually right there&#39;s just money left on the table but how and in what form is always up in the air the original Dev team and the great leader Kevin Lavine left Take 2 to form a new studio which was then acquired by Take 2 and now they&#39;re publishing their new game which is suspiciously Bioshock like but has the numbers filed off which is weird the numbers are filed off despite the fact that they have access to the IP it&#39;s what about what whatever whatever it&#39;s going to inevitably lead to a new BioShock game right hopefully with uh LaVine at the helm um I could just write this whole thing off and say that Judas is the new Bioshock but it looks pretty different you know until Booker and Andrew Ryan show up in the third act at some point man wouldn&#39;t that be OS of Judas with a stealth sequel to Bioshock ah it&#39;s probably not now Bioshock is a controversial franchise BioShock 2 was regarded as not as good and then got a re-evaluation later same goes for BioShock Infinite but really I just want to see that old timey aesthetic combined with some sort of political or ideological angle that gets it a unique flavor just making an immersive Sim in an isolated location isn&#39;t enough otherwise prey is a BioShock game what we want is a return to those vibes of the best parts of the original games gave us doesn&#39;t need to be Rapture doesn&#39;t need to be Colombia remember Bioshock is a insane Multiverse which is why Judas could be a self sequel I don&#39;t know I will say BioShock Infinite got a little lost in the meta narrative and lacks some of the environmental story telling that made the original Bioshock as engaging as it was but the combat to be fair is quite a bit better and the skylines are fun as hell to ride around on especially in battle you could say these types of games have been done to death wandering around around spooky corridors and listening to audio logs uh you could say it&#39;s played out but uh you know it&#39;s not exactly a problem where the genre&#39;s fault that got bad because it got popular everybody in their mother tried to make one of these things at some point and I think the fact that a lot of them aren&#39;t as good as the big ones Bioshock probably being in the top three along with the games that inspired it System Shock to and Thief but just like with those games the tough thing is making something new and to some extent something that maybe maybe works better like as great as these games were a lot of that was the content rather than the mechanics sometimes the mechanics were a little wonky in all of these types of games but you got to capture what made the original game so great and that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s taken them so long to make something with Bioshock and number 19 is Splinter Cell losing Michael Ironsides the iconic voice of Sam Fischer was kind of the death blow to the franchise never recovered after 2013&#39;s Black List which completed the main character&#39;s transformation from grouchy and onc super spy to generic military man number 136 seriously you hear this guy&#39;s voice he&#39;d be indistinguishable as a background Grunt in any Call of Duty campaign I&#39;m entering the plaza wish just blocking the front door access to change position meet you on the ground get eyes from the southwest corner of the plaza copy moving now Grim keep trying to reach our contact let me know if you get through copy The Voice Change was utterly devastating cannot be understated just how bad that voice was so the series has a tough uphill battle if it&#39;s ever coming back there have been rumors of a possible reboot or remake of the first game that have been floating around for years but so far nothing has come of it Ubisoft is just terrible at remaking their games remember Prince of Persia the sands of time remake it was supposed to come out in like 2020 2021 and now they&#39;re saying 2026 guys that game wasn&#39;t complicated what is going on over there so the chances of this series coming back anytime soon are unlikely but come on it&#39;s got to come back eventually right once upon a time time stealth was Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell that was the two premier stealth series serious Prestige there the first three games sold Gang Busters they innovated the stealth genre in a lot of important ways and they were a staple of the gaming ecosystem for a pretty good stretch but once the initial Trilogy was done Ubisoft really couldn&#39;t quite figure out what they wanted the series to be if it were up to me to revive the series I&#39;d go back to the semi-realistic rots set the story in a somewhat plausible reality focus on what makes the series great with hardcore in-depth stealth systems and focus on the best parts of the original game and you know taking some inspiration from more recent stealth games that really knock it out of the park like the world of assassination Hitman Trilogy and make some massive nonlinear levels with lots of subobjectives that can affect the course of the mission there&#39;s so much you could do here and with Metal Gear Solid Mia for the time being there&#39;s definitely room for a new king of stealth games and splitter cell could easily be it just don&#39;t make it another generic open world game that&#39;s that&#39;s the only real like Pratt fall or obstacle I could foresee just bring it back guys at number 18 is legacy of Kane for how popular they were and still are it&#39;s crazy there has not been a real attempt at Reviving this franchise yeah we got that Oddball nazg goth multiplayer game that nobody wanted but a real follow-ups just never materialized there isn&#39;t even like a bare minimum like a new compilation or a remaster of Soul Reaver there&#39;s just there&#39;s nothing there was supposed to be a six entry in the franchise that was going to follow the story post Defiance but it got canceled fans found footage from another cancel sequel called Dead Sun but still just nothing there nothing it&#39;s a shame cuz there was never anything quite like the legacy of cane games like even when the last few entries of it weren&#39;t like Stellar they still had an amazing atmosphere and top-notch voice acting and so I returned to the sanctuary of my enemy The Fortress of the sarafan Brotherhood deemed impossible for any man to penetrate impossible for any man it&#39;ll be tough to make a new game without the dsed tones of Tony Jay but he wasn&#39;t a main character so they could make it work the hard part I think is finding somebody to actually develop it the studio most associated with the series Crystal Dynamics is pretty much the Tomb Raider team we know that the embracer group acquired the IP along with several other Square Enix owned Western IPS but it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;re making a new cane game anytime soon you know because of everything involving embracer seriously uh disastrous couple years for that company if they&#39;re canceling Deus X gamees mid-production Legacy of Kane doesn&#39;t stand a chance right it&#39;s a real shame cuz it&#39;s not hard to imagine what a modern version of the series would look like it&#39; feel right at home with all the other dark fantasy action series that are actually pretty popular now it just have a more cinematic style to it and and yeah that would be fun I&#39;d like that the return of such a venerable franchise assuming the game was good would be an easy slam dunk from my perspective it seems like a safe bet the problem is that it was in the hands of Square Enix who were going to do nothing with it and then embracer who is uh embracer they&#39;re probably going to do nothing with it for now I think for a while they&#39;re probably going to be working on you know patching the hole in their boat those guys are treading some water let me tell you I&#39;m still still kicking them when they&#39;re down you know but uh yeah it&#39;s a franchisees stuck in limbo owned by Publishers who either refuse or can&#39;t make a new game but they also don&#39;t want want to sell it to someone else because you know at some point right and number 17 is Dishonored yeah red fall was a flop and Arcane is in kind of a tough spot right now with the closing of their Austin Texas based Studio but now&#39;s the perfect opportunity to salvage their reputation by going back to what they do best and making a new Dishonored game they kind of sort of wrapped up the story of the games with death of the outsider but there&#39;s a lot they could do with it the setting is so unique that it feels like a big waste ending the series after two games especially after they showed the kind of Innovative stuff they can do with the setting with levels like the Clockwork mansion and the time travel tricks and behind the slab I mean that that was limited by like PS4 Hardware imagine the kind of crazy stuff they could come with now for a third game the possibilities are just endless and that&#39;s what made these game so fun each level felt like a Sandbox where you could explore everything as thoroughly as you wanted finish a mission in 5 minutes or 5 hours it&#39;s up to you there was an unprecedented amount of player freedom in these games it just made them such a joy to play you could play them straight you could go completely nuts with all these Powers at your disposal the stealth was fun the powers were fun running and sliding that was fun in of itself I don&#39;t know what it was about Dishonored sliding it was just so freaking fun to do I know other games have it but it just felt better there Arcane has said the series is on hold uh and they&#39;re currently working on a uh Blade game which you know with another developer I&#39;d probably be pretty hyped with but I I don&#39;t want an immersive Sim with blade and I certainly don&#39;t want them not make making an immersive Sim to make generic blade Souls like TM like they know how to make immersive Sims that&#39;s what they should be doing give blade to platinum games or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] that&#39;d be a hell of a game I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s probably just going to be a safe stupid IP based game Microsoft probably isn&#39;t going to let them throw any hail mares with the you know the closing of half of them the payl Lords you know like obviously I hope blade is good and I hope it&#39;s successful cuz I want the studio to stick around for a very long time and I think that whole idea probably has something to do with that if they throw down and give us something completely unimaginable great but um I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s a really safe bet for a studio the thing that made them famous and number 16 is Dino Crisis with all the revivals capcom&#39;s been making recently there&#39;s one series that&#39;s still conspicuously absent Dino Crisis it&#39;s Resident Evil with Dinosaurs there is nothing else to say there&#39;s only two things anyone knows about these games there&#39;s Regina the main character who&#39;s iconic she&#39;s essential bringing her back is non-negotiable and then there&#39;s dinosaurs like you just need to have those things and it&#39;s that game maybe don&#39;t set it in space that&#39;s what they did in Dino Crisis 3 that didn&#39;t work out too well I arguably killed the series but hey it&#39;s not too hard to make a good dinosaur shooter right it&#39;s been a long freaking time too Dino Crisis 3 was in 2003 it&#39;s been more than 20 years since there&#39;s been a new entry in this series that&#39;s a long time to wait for a followup and they brought back Dogma for Christ&#39;s sake not that that wasn&#39;t a big success it absolutely was but that wasn&#39;t a guarantee the original was you know not a big success not until late in the game with a lot of word of mouth and steam sales at least and no EXO EXO Primal doesn&#39;t count it&#39;s completely unrelated to the Dino Crisis Series yeah it it surprised me too at number 15 Red Faction this one is another one very close to my heart probably nearly as close if not as close as dis HED sadly with the death of volition the hope that there would ever be a new Red Faction gam pretty much dead if we&#39;re being honest the writing was on the wall for a long time didn&#39;t seem like Saint stro was capable of making another Red Faction gorilla like they couldn&#39;t even make a game like it that was a direct followup it seems like they they probably weren&#39;t going to do something as complex uh programming physics wise after Agents Of Mayhem and the Saints Row reboot it&#39;s sad but it&#39;s the truth Red Faction was a series long dead before volition even closed its door doors and you could argue that might be part of why volition closed its doors but then again a Red Faction reboot like the Saints Row reboot wouldn&#39;t have exactly made me happy either but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t want someone anyone to make a new one I mean I guess they could go back to the series roots and make a first-person game with some modular destruction elements the followup to uh gorilla kind of was that a little but you know what everyone wants and it&#39;s not wandering around a mine blowing up tiny chunks of wall we want a new red f gorilla that&#39;s what the world wants but the gaming industry steadfastly refuses to give us that yeah there&#39;s been some fun Little Indie Games that show off an impressive amount of Destruction tear down comes to mind it&#39;s probably the most fully formed of them but the rest of them are more or less Tech demos you can argue that the finals incorporates probably the most extensive version of that nowadays but it&#39;s also not Red Faction gorilla does that make me mad at the finals absolutely not the finals is precious to me but it is also not Red Faction gorilla it&#39;s a multiplayer shooter we&#39;re talking about Red Faction gorilla the thing I want here is Red Faction gorilla like okay so if you&#39;ve ever played the finals you do basically know what a modern game could look like with Red Faction G&#39;s procedural destruction they handled it in fact actually better than Red Faction gorilla so imagine that in a Red Faction gorilla reboot or sequel best fraking thing ever but so far nobody&#39;s willing to attempt it at least not on the level that the game did it wasn&#39;t just test Chambers or short little missions it was an entire open world with so many things to smash yes the world was mostly Barren with a lot of canyons that conveniently separated each area so the game could run on Xbox but those were necessary compromises that the setting itself Mars actually in my opinion kind of Justified so many of those problems will be solved now but with the gaming community so focused on Fidelity I think developers are afraid to make games that don&#39;t look perfect but still incorporate some amazing technology at least when you&#39;re talking about the ones that are capable of looking a lot better with a lot of Indie Studios to be fair pixel Art&#39;s about as good as they could do with the idea and the budget that they might have and that is in no way their fault they&#39;re the little guys and they put out incredible stuff too it&#39;s just somebody publishing a Red Faction game can do a lot more and as far as I know they&#39;re just not willing to put the money into something as experimental as this even though the original games extremely popular among the people who actually played it I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath for this series coming back uh this is another one that got embraced because embracer back in 2018 bought Koch media who was not called Koch media anymore they have a name that I&#39;m not sure how to say and I don&#39;t care enough embracers who who owns Red Faction that&#39;s really that&#39;s what matters and number 14 is Deus X like I said early in the legacy of Kane entry the rights to Deus X were purchased by embracer Fun how there are reasons so many games don&#39;t get made you know being a a games publisher they were going to make a new um Deus X but that got cancelled Hope was formed and then dashed in a single sentence no matter what the flavor of deus X you&#39;re into be it original year 2000 game or the prequels Human Revolution and Mankind divided or if you&#39;re nasty and begotten the sequel Invisible War um regardless you want a new game it&#39;s one of the seminal works of cyber Punk and video games with some really impressive World building and crazy immersive environments personally I&#39;d like a new game more in the tone of the original game with its conspiratorial themes and unusual philosophic diversions maybe with a little bit more of the gameplay of the Adam Jensen game even so I would take a brand new Adam Jensen game with no major you know tonal shifts back to the more original tone but the voice actor for Adam Jensen&#39;s all book confirmed the prequel games are dead which sucks cuz they never got to finish their Story I mean the conclusion was going to be the original Deus X but a lot of plot threads of mankind divided were never resolved and Jensen&#39;s true nature was also never truly revealed lots of unanswered questions and and whole lot of potential just left phow and now that everybody loves cyberpunk 2077 despite its initial disastrous launch it&#39;s going to be a tough act to follow if they made a new DSX now it&#39;s going to get compared to that game which is a full open world RPG DSX doesn&#39;t need to be that huge it needs to be a dense world with an interesting story but the way games are made now a lot of Publishers don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough it is but they don&#39;t think it is and number 133 Oni Musha another entry another Capcom franch trapped in the past Oni Musha should be an easy sell it&#39;s Devil May Cry before Devil May Cry it&#39;s the first real offshoot of the Resident Evil series that went full on action rather than horror those original games uh on the PlayStation 2 were great for some reason Capcom only ported the first one to Modern Hardware but all four of them are really good Oni Musha 3 especially I would put up there with some of the all-time great action games it&#39;s fantastic and has a completely Noto premise yeah that&#39;s the one with Gan renew um time travel is involved uh it is fantastic batshit nuts in the best way games set in Japan are just as popular as ever just this year we&#39;ve gotten several of them hell Capcom put out um kugami which is by the way fantastic I&#39;ve been singing kitsu kami&#39;s praises since it came out not enough people played it if you like Pikman Tower Defense and action games it&#39;s those three things at once and it does it well seriously try it it&#39;s such a good game nobody&#39;s saying no to more Samurai though and for whatever reason reason Capcom refuses to give Oni Musha the series The Respect it deserves maybe there&#39;s rights issues the games did use celebrity likenesses for a lot of its characters but I don&#39;t know I kind of doubt that also I don&#39;t really care I just want more Oni Musha revive the franchise give it that Devil May Cry 5 cat of paint and it&#39;ll sell Gang Busters I promise you I know Capcom is interested in Reviving long dormant franchises so anything&#39;s on the table so like it&#39;s just a matter of them doing it so Capcom do it and number 12 is Mega Man X or Mega Man Legends or Mega Man Battle Network they brought back the original Mega Man with Mega Man 11 but after that game proved successful they stopped yeah they&#39;ve been putting out collections for a while now and it&#39;s cool we can all play the Mega Man X Games pretty easily nowadays and they&#39;ve got the zero and Battle Network games all in one convenient package there but those are all old games I want something new like you&#39;d think we would have gotten a new X game at this point right that seems like the most obvious thing to do after 11 but it hasn&#39;t happened for many folks growing up this is the definitive series I played Mega Man on the NES from the start and X is in my opinion the definitive series part of the problem I think is that Capcom kind of oversaturated the market and the last three games in the series are all different levels of absolutely terrible they really didn&#39;t realize that you just have to make Mega Man X as Mega Man X you come up with new levels you don&#39;t reinvent the wheel The Innovation is in the levels and adding new powers and stuff like that it&#39;s not I mean I don&#39;t want a 3D Mega Man X it doesn&#39;t work is it terrible no but relative to any good Mega Man X game yes it is terrible Also let&#39;s let&#39;s talk Mega Man Legends right there was going to be a sequel but it got cancelled and the series has just been Nostalgia baate ever since hell they could at least make a new Battle Network and those were those were crazy popular games they have one of the most interesting battle systems in any RPG sing a modern version with new bells and whistles would be freaking awesome like think about Mega Man Battle Network looking like Persona how capcom&#39;s got the money just partner with Atlas and and do it I don&#39;t think Sega would be too upset to take some cash there like there&#39;s so many dead Mega Man franchises uh really if you want to split hairs Mega Man like where&#39;s 12 11 was a fully realized badass sequel it was hard as hell but uh I mean not the hardest in the Mega Man series it doesn&#39;t need to be the hardest they they gave us some pretty good levels in 2018 at number 11 is time Splitters the true spiritual sequel to Golden KN 007 it&#39;s not perfect dark well it is but they made perfect dark zero which sucked and time Splitters got two great follow-ups so I ask you which is the franchise that truly deserves a followup uh both in a perfect world but if it&#39;s if in in an imperfect world where you can only pick one it&#39;s got to be time Splitters all right there&#39;s really nothing quite like these games they&#39;ve got the perfect amount of multiplayer chaos their single player campaigns are fun and quirky they&#39;re just great games that manage to be the best spiritual successor while having a unique identity of its own what really kills me about this one is there was going to be Time spls 4 it was happening and and it got embraced like if it&#39;s any indicator embracer has a lot to answer for it seems like every other game on this list it was going to get a comeback and then embracer embraced everything about it the hope is still alive for time splitter so anything&#39;s possible when you&#39;re writing Pie in the Sky YouTube lists these kinds of lists aren&#39;t necessarily wish fulfillment it&#39;s more wish having uh if you put it out out there it&#39;s it&#39;s better than not putting it out there right that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing here time Splitters is a series that uh by all accounts should return it exists in its own little niche there really aren&#39;t other games like it doing exactly what it does the variety of weapons the goofy modes the golden eye style aiming the varied campaigns oh and the cartoonish art style it&#39;s really just a unique series there is no other and it deserves a proper comeback and number 10 is Banjo kazui F this one under duh everyone wants a new banjo people put millions of dollars kickstarting what is essentially a clone game and to be frank banjo kazui had moved beyond that Paradigm and moved into being Legend of Zelda tears of the kingdoms building stuff long before that even existed a and it wouldn&#39;t bother me to see some of that stuff return in a true banjo sequel but here&#39;s the thing where&#39;s banjo bring back banjo everyone wants banjo people went bat it crazy when it got announced for for smash but rare nowadays is not the same company that made uh the various SNES and Nintendo 64 Classics uh banjo kazui being one not to say their recent output is bad there&#39;s just none of it or at least not much of it it&#39;s not bad though just not what the fans of their old games want they were the guys who did collectathon probably the best the big cartoonish levels we run around picking up tons of crap for some reason while giant Kirk hopes bouncy score plays who want powerups and mini games and all that stuff that these games are known for uh what a lot of people don&#39;t want want is the custom Vehicles aspect I like the custom Vehicles aspect I think that it could exist inside the traditional banjo kazui Paradigm not be the primary focus of it and be quite enjoyable [Music] honestly but nuts and bolts is not the game that most fans wanted in Hind site I think it&#39;s an interesting game very creative again like I said did tears of the Kingdom before tears of the Kingdom if nuts and bolts was just a spin-off and a third proper game had come out I don&#39;t think anybody would be sour about it but the third game never happened at this point like just give the license to the Clone guys the ukulele guys I mean all the founders of platonic the creators of ukulele came from the original rare that rare isn&#39;t anymore so they have a pretty good grasp on how that kind of game works the original ukulele was a rough but the Sid scrolling sequel is actually a lot better if rear is not going to have anything to do with banjo though they might as well like let somebody else do it the right way it doesn&#39;t need to be like Earth shaking it just needs to be banjo kazui and number nine is burnout it seems like every major racing game focuses on semi-realism you know cartooning and following race lines and driving carefully and precisely that&#39;s what Need for Speed and fors and test D limited all want to do these days the lack of a game like burnout is conspicuous where are the insane speeds the boosts the gnarly crashes most razors basically don&#39;t have car deformation anymore what is that and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s exclusive to more arcadey or insane stuff like burnout there is pretty good car deformation in a few various racing games like a beam ng drive but you just you don&#39;t get the same absolute decimation that could be inflicted on a vehicle in a game like burnout imagine a modern AAA burnout with physics like BMG dve that&#39;d be [Music] insane soft body physics burnout would be I that&#39;d be a perfect game these games are all about aggression you crash opponents crash into traffic in the environment you just keep going crashing is in a fail State half the time it is the goal and it&#39;s got the after touch ability where can steer your car after crashing which allows for some Vengeance even when you&#39;re kening out of control these games are freaking awesome either The Originals or the open world Burnout Paradise I&#39;m fine with a followup in either direction the only big thing I I absolutely cannot do without is crash mode it&#39;s one of the greatest game modes in history they somehow turn a four-way pile up into a satisfying puzzle the saddest thing about this series is the studio that made them still around criterion&#39;s still with EA but they&#39;re stuck as a support Studio forever toiling away in the Need for Speed in Battlefield Minds instead of a mind-blowing new burnout game they&#39;re stuck making crappy modes for Battlefield 2042 that nobody&#39;s going to play anyway truly a fate worse than death and number eight is True Crime but really Sleeping Dogs let&#39;s be real here everyone wants a new Sleeping Dogs that game was great a real viable alternative to Grand Theft Auto and that&#39;s not an easy thing to do it did its own thing it was different was more arcadey a little more action-packed without being a total cartoon like Saints Row it struck just the right balance between serious and silly in a way that Grand Theft Auto doesn&#39;t in a just world the developer would have gone on to great success there would have been multiple sequels it could have been absolutely amazing instead we got two kind of weird mediocre true crime games one great True Crime game and then they had to change the name because it was acquired by Square Enix and one failed MMO followup that nobody wanted the fact Sleeping Dogs managed to come out at all is a minor miracle it was even more impressive that it was actually good though it should have been simple just make a sequel that was like the first one but better but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not that simple if you look at the development history you&#39;ll see just how bizarre of a production history united front games has they made Mod Nation Racers a little big planet carding game The Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider just the definitive edition nothing else sandwich between that is a highly polished big budget open world action game like maybe they were just incapable of making a followup I I just don&#39;t know what happened there were plans to make sleeping dogs too but it never got off the ground it would be absolutely awesome if some other talented Studio could come in and continue where they left off or if they would do it either way but the likelihood of either happening is pretty low might as well be zero honestly from the looks still even though it probably will never happen it should and number seven is Spyro the Dragon that guy he&#39;s heavily rumored to fly again thanks to the newly independent games for Bob but at the time of this writing we have no idea what their mystery game is could be a new IP could be a Spyro sequel we all want it to be will it be I don&#39;t know once Insomniac was done with the series after three games various Publishers conspired to drive this series into the ground first we got vend is embarrassingly bad enter the dragonfly then bizarre eurocom reboot games where Spyro is voiced by froto himself Elijah would wa Gary Gary Oldman was in these things David Spade as Sparks that can&#39;t be real that it it is though those first three PlayStation games were great though I mean this is insaniac we&#39;re talking about those guys have been consistently good for the past 20 plus years Toys for Bob no slouch either I mean they did those Skylanders games but they&#39;ve been around forever and they work on the Spyro re master was absolutely Stellar after the crash collection they made crash 4 so everyone expected they&#39;d be doing a proper Spyro 4 eventually as well and then they left Activision so it seemed like the dream was dead then they turned around and immediately made a deal with Microsoft so it&#39;s possible they&#39;re doing an actual Spyro game and I hope they are they made a lot of small but smart improvements to the remasters and crash 4 was absolutely excellent barring the sometimes overturned difficulty Spyro was never about Precision platforming though was more just about being a fun game with a unique move set no other game makes it as fun to charge around everywhere as Spyro does Nobody Does it Like Spyro period it&#39;s a simple series but the originals really still hold up a proper modern sequel feels like a no-brainer and number six is Crimson Skies uh if all you had was an Xbox you might not even be aware that Crimson Skies was a franchise it actually started out on PC the original game was super different from uh the more arcadey Xbox followup but it&#39;s mostly still a real Aviation game which is just with slightly more uh forgiving physics the PC original is a real classic and but the Xbox version is great too they&#39;re very different games the Xbox game you kind of fly an arwing from Star Fox any semblance of simulation is kind of thrown out the window but the alternate universe 1930 setting is awesome the the music was absolutely great the mission Design&#39;s topnotch is a series that really should have seen more success my cover&#39;s blown repeat my cover&#39;s blown I need backup attention this settlement is operating in violation of David dunbar&#39;s anti-piracy act got me I think a modern Crimson Skies would really work they could inov at by borrowing uh from something like Dark Void where you occasionally get out of your plane and do a shootout on foot not something I do all the time uh again to bring up Star Fox um it all the all the on foot crap did not work in that one Star Fox game but I mean it would mix things up a little and if you do it right uh it&#39;s good but I mean will would they do it right that lame Front Mission reboot game also did something like that wasn&#39;t great so maybe I&#39;m asking for the monkeys paw to curl with this one um but however this hypothetical unamed mystery developer decides to modernize the series I&#39;d be there for it at number five an actual new castellania game with all the remasters and remakes and DLCs that Konami is putting out for this series seriously I mean look back over the last decade it&#39;s easy to forget that there hasn&#39;t been a new Castlevania since 2014 wait I lie there&#39;s actually the haunted castle remake that came packed in with the Dominus collection that&#39;s pretty much built from the ground up but at the end of the day it&#39;s still a remake it is the closest thing to something new we&#39;ve seen in the series for about 10 years so any chance there is for hope uh fans are going to take [Music] it there&#39;s so many directions they could go with a new game they could make a new classic game they could go the Metroid Vania route like they could make a Lords of Shadow sequel I&#39;d be fine with that it&#39;ll have to be better than Lords of Shadow 2 you couldn&#39;t make something worse if you tried but still if you&#39;re dying a thirst in the desert you don&#39;t complain about what&#39;s in the canteen someone hands you as long as it ain&#39;t poison you drink it and you like it unless it&#39;s another uh Castlevania Pachinko machine then get the hell out of here with that moving on to number four it&#39;s ninja giden another series that&#39;s been away from the spotlight for quite a while the NES games are classic in ninja giden black on the original Xboxes one of the best action games of all time but after they flopped hard with one of the biggest unforced errors in gaming history with Ninja Guiden 3 team ninjas pretty much moved on to other things they still do good work and all the recent games are are pretty damn solid but I can&#39;t help what wonder what this modern revitalized version of Team ninja could do if they return to their Roots it doesn&#39;t have to be ninja guide and black all over again if they wanted they could even make a new soulslike style game just yeah got to have a jump button strong movement abilities are a major part of the identity of ninja guen along with pretty high difficulty so obviously it couldn&#39;t be a straightforward Souls like but maybe they could bring bring back a somewhat more grounded reality like the original NES game where a few places almost look like the real world and there were CI agents skullking around as opposed to the total fantasy world of the Xbox game but this is another case where it doesn&#39;t really matter what they do it it&#39; just be nice if they did something [Music] new and number three is Death Jam these games were nuts it&#39;s not really a surpris they didn&#39;t last long cuz they were totally relying on licensing everything had to license appearances music absolutely everything it would have been a fun game without rappers playing themselves but that&#39;s really what pushes the game Over The Edge from an interesting curio to an all-time great it was just so much freaking fun it was developed by akie or Akai I don&#39;t really say the name of that developer often the wrestling game guys and it plays like a streamline version of those games it works though cuz honestly it&#39;s a lot better than most wrestling games for back then and even now they just hit the perfect temp where uh fights are flashy and fun but they don&#39;t drag on too long and they&#39;re really accessible it&#39;s easy to jump in jump out play with friends and that&#39;s the best way to play these games period the first two games are alltime Classics and have a pretty good cross-section of major acts from the early 2003s imagine if they made one of these things now it&#39;d be totally crazy but also very unlikely I loved these things as a kid the music the presentation the real world rappers it&#39;s just so much freaking fun it feels like something you could only pull off in the 2000s I can&#39;t see the biggest rappers lending their voices and appearances to something like this now other than IC tea he would probably do it and number two is siren the first two siren games developed by Japan studio and published by Sony were straight up terrifying they&#39;re some of the most unsettling horror games ever made but outside of an illc conceived attempt at a reboot with siren blood curse the series has been dead for almost two decades they didn&#39;t catch on back in the early 2000s but I think now they would have a much better chance of catching an audience they&#39;re grungy a little awkward to control they have impenetrable stories it can only be fully understood after multiple playthroughs that sort of thing wasn&#39;t generally understood as a positive back then but now oh we love our obscure games don&#39;t we did you feel anything else they are no longer be careful it will be a while until you can move through the most possibly opaque the better there&#39;s real potential for a Revival too people love horror games now especially spiritual successors to Silent Hill woe the main problem for any Revival is Sony themselves they&#39;ve all but shutter their Japan studio and don&#39;t seem that interested in publishing another game as strange and unsettling is this one its appeal is too limited for Sony looking for the next big live service hit as if that&#39;s going to happen they don&#39;t want Moody horror games they want Concord which flopped horribly and cost like $200 million maybe they should go back to the single player horror game games or just single player games in general it seems like Sony is going through one of those phases where they forgot why people like them and finally at number one be still my Beating Heart Chrono Trigger Chrono cross makes this a Bonafide franchise but let&#39;s not fool anyone here as much as cross has its own fan following and it does do stuff that expands the lore in weird ways I like it but we really want a new Chrono Trigger a proper followup that is the same fast-paced and fun Story the time hopping Shenanigans and that fantastic iconic score um chronocross89 new little gimmicks new dungeons new party members new time periods this this game is just on the Go the whole time it&#39;s also one of the shortest of these squaresoft RPG Classics but there is not a hint of fat on this thing it is all killer no filler and most RPGs are like 90% filler that&#39;s what people want sure we all love the 100 hour Behemoth every once in a while but games don&#39;t need to be massively bloated to be good in fact bloated is bad it doesn&#39;t mean the game is bad but the bloat sure is is Chrono Trigger perfect example of something without any o that bloat and that&#39;s all for today leave us a comment

justify the price eg a lot of that more is stuff you don&#39;t want to bother with and it kind of gets just left in the dust as you do the stuff that&#39;s fun if possible anyway hi folks it&#39;s Falcon and today on game ranks 10 things you just leave unfinished in single player games let&#39;s start off with number 10 side quests and I don&#39;t mean all of them obviously there are games with very good side quests but let&#39;s let&#39;s entertain this scenario you&#39;re walking along the path minding your own business and then some desperate NPC runs up to you Bandits kidnapped my baby please help me if you help me I shall reward you with 400 coins I have 400 coins sir this is Tony Hawk Underground and I am trying to do a mctwist over the helicopter in Hawaii thank you very much I do not need 400 coins H I am also dying of the super flu and need 100 herbs you can collect 50 of them on this side of that wall that comes down when you do a 1080 mcloven off of a kickflip but you have to get to the other side of that wall to get all of the herbs I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just playing up how absurd side quest can be I should probably get back to talking about them um anyway you skip through all that stupid dialogue and find the fastest way to accept the request you know because it&#39;s the only way to end that conversation and sometimes you&#39;re like like ah yeah sure I&#39;ll help that guy out he&#39;s got the super flu and his something was kidnapped I don&#39;t know that was a long time ago he talked a lot and then you go collect the herbs and then this is just what I [Applause] need it turns into oh it&#39;s not just the herbs you also need another ingredient and then five ingredients later you need to get like a cauldron to make it all into a soup or some crap but wait the bandits that kidnapped whoever are also the ones with the cauldron so you have to do all of the kidnapping quest line thing it&#39;s just it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot so you have this in addition to all of your actual real quests that progress the story and matter a and then there&#39;s also the side quests that don&#39;t suck so you end up getting wrapped up in something else and you forget here&#39;s the thing most people just don&#39;t bother with side quests I mean hell 14% of players have competed even 10 quests in Skyrim special edition that means 86% players never even bothered with most of the quests forget side quest quests in the game there&#39;s over 700 of them so most people who played Skyrim are barely scratching the service that&#39;s a lot of broken lives with you know super flu and kidnapped children or whatever like maybe if these NPCs were a little more proactive they wouldn&#39;t be in this mess in the first place uh like think about it maybe don&#39;t hang around Bandits if you&#39;ve got a a a a baby you never know what Bandits are going to do also stop talking like that like they get actors who try to add flavor to these Side characters and it&#39;s always it&#39;s always just too much obviously there are exceptions technically the entire bloody Baron thing in The Witcher is a side quest and it feels as important if not more important than the main quest in that game but games that actually get it in that way like on that level especially do not come around often most of the time side quests are basic throwaway stuff that they try to guilt you into doing with some crazy like uh soab story it&#39;s just stupid I hate them I don&#39;t bother with them the lands are such fertile ground for games the inhabitants are so oish you can fill your pockets with hardly any efforts are you going to give us what&#39;s rightfully ours or do we need to start a new game and number nine is optional bosses in a lot of like Souls likes there are extra bosses and they are in fact the reward they&#39;re the reason you&#39;re playing the game but sometimes I can&#39;t be bothered you know how it goes sometimes you you wander down some path you run into a boss and you just turn around yeah I don&#39;t have the patience for this right now there&#39;s other things I want to do in the game etc etc this can be a problem in Souls likes where bosses are considered like the candy part but it&#39;s especially bad when you&#39;re not playing a souls likee and random boss pops up and you don&#39;t want to engage with it I don&#39;t have to fight it right now most the time rewards are barely worth the effort so why bother right a lot of the best fights in particularly Souls Lex but Metroid vanas and stuff like that they&#39;re optional but there comes a time when you&#39;re just kind of like all right you want to get to the next part of the game like there are things that happen in games that carry some sort of narrative weight that you know you want to get to and let&#39;s face it the Moss golum is not going to be super different from the sand golum right he&#39;s going to be weak to something different sure but it&#39;s not always exactly inspired let&#39;s say even for the most dedicated Souls player there comes a time when the answer is just no no more it&#39;s optional it doesn&#39;t matter at all so if you leave it unfinished and hell you can lie about it no one has to know the terrible truth that you skipped the boss in a Souls game or any game and number eight is the Collectibles so many games tease us with a completion challenge we&#39;re aware at pretty much all times just how little of the actual game we&#39;ve completed very few people get 100% most people just don&#39;t try I don&#39;t it&#39;s tedious as hell and takes forever to do and usually you have to do a bunch of stuff that sucks there&#39;s a reason not to many people make collectathon Platformers anymore and it&#39;s because the collectible thing has basically been used and abused by every genre in order to pad out the achievements must so some it&#39;s a mechanic that has been run into the ground for what I would call unsavory purposes laziness particular one of the seven deadly sins is sloth and and I swear to God the fact I can&#39;t 100% Assassin&#39;s Creed without filling up eto&#39;s little brother&#39;s box with feathers or whatever there&#39;s like a hundred of them they&#39;re scattered all over the place you want to know how little I need feathers to be an assassin am I saying it&#39;s impossible to kill somebody with a feather no I I I think probably some enterprising assassin who&#39;s extra clever can probably do that somewhere in the world but Assassin&#39;s Creed is not one of those places um I&#39;m trying to be an assassin here why are you asking me for a 100 feathers what is that imagine if somebody did that in real life went up to somebody coldhearted enough to be part of a killing organization and be like hey can you give me a bunch of feathers please in video games we just take being a kleptomaniac hoarder for granted picking up every coin we see and adding it to the treasure hord and like I said collectons were a genre of games that were all about that but it&#39;s just not fun anymore as a like full game concept when you&#39;re asked to go out and get 900 cororo seeds or whatever a rare few are mad as a Hatter and actually try to get everything in these games you really have to be when you basically get nothing for your efforts you do the cororo one you get like a golden turd and I&#39;m not joking it is a golden turd uh but at least at least those games kind of acknowledge how unlikely it is to get all that stuff by not hiding something serious behind it but then there&#39;s Batman Arkham Knight which doesn&#39;t let you get the actual ending of the game until you get all 243 Riddler trophies on top of everything else in the game you&#39;re supposed to be Batman the cape Crusader the iron Vengeance guy but by the end of the game you&#39;re wandering around like uh one of those guys that&#39;s really into geocaches like you ever you ever seen those guys they&#39;re not very Batman like like the vast vast majority of people never actually do all this stuff as much as that completion percentage bothers the OCD gamer mind actually taking the time to get everything is so boring and tedious only the most determined with the least amount of things to do in real life are willing to do it [Music] and number seven is your house you know how it goes you&#39;re playing a game you unlock a house or a settlement or whatever you get a building ability right maybe it&#39;s a survival game you can build stuff by default doesn&#39;t really matter how it starts but always ends the same way you go in with good intentions you&#39;re can to clean up the farm rebuild a settlement recruit all the NPCs and whatnot this game&#39;s going to be different I&#39;m not going to uh neglect this place in fact I&#39;m going to make it fancy I&#39;m going to build the ultimate house it&#39;s going to be awesome and then you spend a few minutes on it and you&#39;re like ah this isn&#39;t really why I bought this game is it this is a firstperson shooter why am I doing this so yeah instead of the opulent Mansion you wanted the rest of the game you&#39;re kind of running back to your pathetic little one room Shack that has a treasure chest in it to dump off your excess inventory because that&#39;s the only way to actually keep it safe it&#39;s got to be inside some walls right like I&#39;m not saying building in games can&#39;t be satisfying it can there are certain games that actually feel good to do this in despite the fact that there&#39;s the whole rest of the game there for you to do but a lot of the time it&#39;s a really timeconsuming distraction that it&#39;s not really that worthwhile depending on what kind of player you are you may not have the patience or creative drive to spend time building a proper settlement and you literally do what the game requires you to do before you can stop messing with that mechanic a hand and number six and this is going to sound unnecessarily General but you&#39;ll get it by the end uh anything where you actually have to think for those of us who are doing side quest sometimes you reach a point where they&#39;re bridge too far and this is that point when a game doesn&#39;t just roly tell you where to go and what to do it makes you think and engage in a way that isn&#39;t really worth it for what you&#39;re doing and sometimes uh you turn on a game that&#39;s not about thinking and they give you like a murder mystery to solve like when you should be out clearing Outpost or some some [\u00a0__\u00a0] and the thing is H you find out who the Killer is and you stop him and what effect does it have on anything nothing like you got some item or something maybe hey feel like solving a murder I&#39;m the Mur commcial around these parts uh one of these gutter quadruplets pulled the trigger on that boy over there consider yourself deputized there are a lot of games that I play where the main quest line does actually involve thinking but there are stakes and reasons why that thinking is satisfying to do because it brings you to your objective and rewards you and then of course there&#39;s a lot of games that I am playing not to think at all but uh you know I I don&#39;t want to you know solve some randoms incredibly complic ated problems for no for no real reward I just don&#39;t want to which of these four guys is telling the truth and which is lying well uh eeny meeny miny mo it&#39;s that guy sorry if you&#39;re innocent you&#39;re going to jail I&#39;m moving on that&#39;s just what happens when you ask some random off the street to deal with your life and death dilemma NPCs sure it&#39;s fun sometimes I I mentioned the Bloody Baron side quest in a different example for a different reason this has elements of that type of quest quest in it and it&#39;s amazingly rewarding to complete particularly from a narrative perspective which normally side quests are not like that but again there&#39;s a reason why everyone points at the Bloody Baron as an incredible example of a side quest it&#39;s because there are almost no other ones that are at that level in any game and number five is relationship values you know how in a lot of RPGs there&#39;s always some kind of measurement of how much your party members like you like in Dragon Age and Fallout you have the sort of a approval ratings in Persona you have the Social Links for the social butterfly gamer these things are something to eat up like catnip but for a lot of other Gamers the relationship building stuff gets in the way of what we&#39;re actually here to do which is Bonk monsters on the head with swords I&#39;ll admit that the Persona social link stuff I think is the exception that really gets me involved I like how you get new moves and stuff for doing it and often it does change the narrative even in like Fallout and stuff but I totally get why people don&#39;t do it I don&#39;t do it in most other games often I ignore personal quests like the plague I&#39;m just not interested unless they really made a good character and whatever they have going on is actually genuinely interesting I&#39;m not generally going to do these things what I hate though is when you do that and it leaves like somebody sidelined for the rest of the game man I sure hope none of this matters in the end right boy that would suck if in the last 5 minutes of the game my entire party turns out uh to hate my guts and not want to do anything anything with me that wouldn&#39;t be a fun surprise oh yeah that actually happens in never winter Nights by the way half your party will turn on you if your relationship with them isn&#39;t good enough there&#39;s just no time for personal quests in Mass Effect 2 you got to do the suicide mission as soon as possible what could possibly go wrong oh that&#39;s right tally just melted in a pipe my bad building relationships in RPGs is one of those things you&#39;re either 100% into or don&#39;t care about at all um I generally like it when it&#39;s just built into the story and happens like I don&#39;t have to make iten happen it doesn&#39;t divert me away from the main quest to develop the relationships between the various characters in my party I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no game that does this that I don&#39;t like I mentioned persona but even with that it&#39;s an exercise and optimization you really have to go way out of your way to max out all the Social Links I generally just go for the Social Links that are with the most interesting characters and get me the best moves that I&#39;ll actually use in my party like building relationships in RPGs in my opinion is just happen narratively speaking and giving you a penalty because you didn&#39;t want to bother with it kind of sucks when it comes back and bites you in the butt and number four the main quest I&#39;m going to bring up the damn bloody Baron again all right so Tris is waiting to meet you in novag grad right that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do but damn if fil Margera in a medieval red coat isn&#39;t more interesting legitimately the Bloody Baron is such a good side quest it feels like it is absolutely necessary more than anything anything else you&#39;re doing at the moment and that includes all the main stuff in the game it&#39;s such a complex set of relationships that you don&#39;t really know what the good thing to do is and it has you doing such weird crap it&#39;s of course not like the only example uh like Nakamura might be waiting for you at dinner and maybe the gang&#39;s patiently waiting for Arthur to come back after wandering off at the second chapter 2 started I don&#39;t know depending on what type of game we&#39;re talking about here the main quest can uh get neglected take any open world game like with sandbox elements for most players the story of a GTA game ends the second you&#39;re done with the tutorial I&#39;m not saying that this is me I have most certainly gotten CJ&#39;s brother out of prison every time I played Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but I know what Grand Theft Auto is and I completely get it when people don&#39;t like does John marsten really ever need to reunite with his family I don&#39;t know that ends everything so maybe not does Etso need to form that Brotherhood you get through the opening section and the story is is just in Eternal stasis from that point forward you screw around in the open world you cause chaos clear out a few camps and then put the game away if a game&#39;s got a compelling enough open world it&#39;s just more fun to screw around and do sides up like I said earlier 14% of Skyrim users ever complete more than 10 quests there&#39;s a reason for that even when the story&#39;s good sometimes you just want to play Cowboy for a few minutes and shut the game off and number three is bonus dungeons ah I&#39;ve almost be in the game now I just want to wander around the map see what I missed oh what&#39;s this 100 Floor dungeon filled with enemies harder and the last boss takes 4 hours to beat how many save points are there oh none you say if I die I have to restart the whole thing yeah screw that um Tower in breath of the wild I screw it just absolutely screw it I&#39;ve tried and then I&#39;ve died and then after I lose enough of that progress I&#39;m done sure hardest challenge in the game My reward might be bragging rights or the Ultimate Sword or whatever the game&#39;s already beaten I&#39;m already done I&#39;m already done with the game most of the time the bonus dungeons aren&#39;t even fun a lot of time they&#39;re just artlessly inserted into re-released games to put another bullet point on the back cover and they&#39;re not fun they just reuse assets from the rest of the game there&#39;s nothing new or interesting to find they&#39;re extremely long they&#39;re tedious and they add basically nothing to the experience but make it longer it&#39;s not always the case of course but there&#39;s no Bloody Baron of the bonus Tower with 100 floors all right it&#39;s never that good I&#39;m not wasting 15 extra hours playing boring content in the game I&#39;ve got a game for every floor in the tower in my backlog to at least try and number two is the DLC most people don&#39;t buy the DLC for games right look at the completion rates of DLC only achievements in most games it&#39;s usually close to zero I played the bolt gun DLC recently and the amount of people getting achievements in the expansion was like 05% that&#39;s 12th of 1% also yeah I do buy dlc&#39;s but if you&#39;re anything like me you&#39;re like Ah that&#39;s a good game I&#39;ll get around of that and then you don&#39;t you get distracted by something else and you forget about it or maybe you do the start of the DLC realize you&#39;re underleveled underprepared you start the game over and you lose interest because you just played the rest of the game over again to do better at the DLC and it was not something you really wanted to do but you did it for the DLC and then by the time you got to the DLC it&#39;s like ah this isn&#39;t worth it sometimes just starting the DLC is a pain you got to get halfway through the game complete this obscure side quest and it&#39;s already failed when you load up your save because you already got too far so you got to look up how to even start the damnn thing like in bloodborne with the only way to start the DLC was to get grabbed by an invisible hand at a random spot like there were people that complained about the Elden ring DLC starting point sorry try the bloodborne one and I&#39;m going to mention a different Quest from Witcher 3 now blood and wine just let you jump into the new stuff it&#39;s basically a separate game I mean they set your level at a certain point give you specific equipment but thing is if you want Siri to be Queen you&#39;re going to have to play the whole game over and then play the DLC but still you can play the DLC but I&#39;ll tell you this what&#39;s probably the worst is when you&#39;ve set a game aside cuz it&#39;s done and over with and you kind of lose your Edge forget how to play it a little bit then you buy the DLC and jump back into it and the game expects you to have uh been an expert all along and you feel like you have no idea what you&#39;re doing there&#39;s a lot of barriers that keep people from playing and completing single player DLC I can&#39;t blame someone for just giving up and not bothering and I think I&#39;ve just explained to you the entire reason why we never got any Grand Theft Auto 5 DLC let&#39;s like are people going to buy it if they&#39;re not really going to play it I would guess a lot of people might answer no but they will play Grand Theft Auto online got to get those Shark cards man sad but true and finally at number one the true secret ending what do you mean you didn&#39;t get the secret ending all you have to do is beat the game then complete this obscure side quest and go back to this hidden area and pick all the right dialogue options and don&#39;t forget to eat the umbilical cords while rejecting the giant wish granter that was a mouthful um most of the time getting the secret ending is is a huge pain in the ass it&#39;s just not worth the extra effort usually all you get for your trouble is seven extra seconds a cut scene taged on the end for a sequel hook that&#39;s never going to get followed up on anyway sure some games have secret endings that are pretty easy to Su out by today&#39;s sandard The Secret of Symphony of the Night is pretty you not secret but so many games have obscure nearly impossible to find hidden endings that no human being in their right Minds would ever discover them on their own without some kind of guide those are the ones most of us just don&#39;t bother with they force you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty with no Autos saving collect all the perfect speedrunning relics and uh you know stuff is theoretically possible for a human being to do but it&#39;s very hard for me too you know you got to press a button in the middle of a cut scene you didn&#39;t know about and that didn&#39;t happen anywhere else in the game so thanks for that secret endings can be some real BS and I don&#39;t blame anyone for ignoring them you beat the game once you got an ending that&#39;s basically what people want like finishing the game at all is an accomplishment just give me the trophy for that even if it&#39;s just a participation trophy let&#39;s wrap this thing up all right let&#39;s let&#39;s wrap it up I&#39;m not wrapping it up by the way I have a bonus for you maong otherwise known as a miname where 100% runs go to die some Yakuza games want you to get a high score in maong to finish them but I do not know how to play majang I&#39;ve learned how to play maong countless times I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t understand it it doesn&#39;t stay with me and this is where I draw the line I&#39;m not I&#39;m not going to do this I get the basic idea it&#39;s like poker You&#39;re Building hands I don&#39;t understand how the scoring Works might as well be theoretical physics I am not doing a doctoral thesis to get to the end of a of a yakas a game sorry I&#39;ll take any other obscure Japanese board game shogi more like easy Koi Koi CeeLo oi kabu all that stuff it&#39;s nothing maong it&#39;s impenetrable unless you are a Midwestern grandma and I am not I don&#39;t understand why they get it by the way why do they get it it&#39;s a hyp specific issue but there&#39;s so many yakaza games that they&#39;re basically a genre all to the VES and so many of these things come out a year uh that they can easily dominate the single player game time especially if you&#39;re one of those lunatics who want to 100% all of it at my advice do maong first cuz it&#39;s what separates the standard completionists from the degenerate psychos willing to put themselves through the torture of not just trying to win but understanding maong that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for you today leave us a comment let us know what you think if you like this video click like if you&#39;re not subscribe now is a great time to do so we upload brand new videos every day of the

      "subtitles": "hello folks today is Friday September 20th 2024 as usual my name is Jake baldino here to talk about all the video game news that has been going on this week there&#39;s a bunch of stuff to dive into the first thing being PlayStation 6 already I know you&#39;re probably asking yourself that but uh there&#39;s some interesting news here and possibly a little bit of info leaked uh the first thing the biggest news of course is the announcement that AMD is once again going to be supplying the chips for the next PlayStation this report comes from Reuters I will link that in the description down below as well as everything else I talk about apparently this deal has been finalized and it&#39;s been in the works since 2022 uh these things usually typically do take a long time so this announcement isn&#39;t the most surprising thing in the world we knew for a while who was doing the chips in the PS5 of course they&#39;ve worked with AMD for quite some time now already so this part parip makes sense all you can really take from this is that yes there is another PlayStation coming eventually it&#39;s probably not going to be anytime soon but it seems like it&#39;s going to be powered by AMD interestingly enough according to this report intel was trying to go for this they were trying to kind of break back into the console Market they&#39;ve been involved in the past but uh this was essentially their big attempt to come back but AMD won out once again the full piece is interesting if you like Tech news and you like following this stuff stuff it is essentially framed around how Intel technically lost out this business with PlayStation but along with that I have also seen some leaks circulating around some people on message boards suggesting they already know uh the deal behind the chipset and the fact that the ps6 will have two s so&#39;s which is interesting but again this is just like a leak of rumor speculation take it with a grain of salt but I I did see that floating around out there so I&#39;ll link that thread as well I think all I can do is collectively with all of you guys say slow down this is probably the last we&#39;re going to hear about ps6 for a while but at least the AMD news seemingly is pretty close to official thanks to reuter&#39;s reporting along with that of course if you if you missed earlier this week PlayStation announced 30th Anniversary Edition Hardware uh for both their regular PS5 as well as PlayStation portal their line of controllers and the upcoming PS5 Pro they&#39;re all going to have a really slick PlayStation one style and packaging and accessories and this isn&#39;t an ad or anything like I just think this looks awesome and I know I complained and I have big issues with the price of the PS5 Pro but I&#39;m also part of the problem and I think this console looks absolutely awesome they did this for the PS4 and I missed out on that so we&#39;ll see what happens this time I do think this is going to be a scalper hellscape so for the people that have the money and actually do want to get this and own this I hope it works out for them but I I think it&#39;s going to be really tough and quantities are going to be limited you know maybe that&#39;s better for our wallet or our credit card debt or whatever we have but uh let&#39;s move on the other big bit of news this week something I didn&#39;t expect right away but it&#39;s news about the next Battlefield yes we now have a confirmation of Battlefield setting sort of it&#39;s going to take place in modern day yes they are going back to the Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 type of thing specifically uh with EA&#39;s Vince sella who is now of course head of respawn but also Al head of a lot of other EA stuff uh said that they are going back to what he called Peak Battlefield which is Battlefield 3 and four and that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to do again the Back to Basics approach seems to be the main Mantra here I&#39;ve heard that in the past with games we&#39;re going back to Our Roots We&#39;re Going Back to Basics I think that is still something that is a concept that we have to see to believe talk is one thing but seeing that executed is the real thing cuz I really I feel like with the last Battlefield they were like oh yeah we&#39;re going back to what players really want and then that kind of launched a really rough state so we&#39;ll see but we know that it is current day and there&#39;s a piece of concept art revealed from IGN and it just looks like a European city some people have speculated like a a small French city or an Italian city I don&#39;t know but there&#39;s other little things like aerial battles in that concept art helicopters as well as what looks to be a forest fire which could be interesting if there&#39;s like natural disasters going on as you&#39;re trying to like shoot other men that&#39;s an interesting concept especially if they do kind of like world changing events in these big large scale battles they did also mention large scale battles that&#39;s what they want to focus on again so the next Battlefield as we know right now is in production apparently next year they&#39;re going to reveal a little bit in terms of how fans can get involved with I guess presumably alphas and betas and stuff like that but for now all we have to go on is this logo and this little piece of concept art and Vince zella&#39;s words I really hope it works out for them this time Battlefield is a great franchise even if it&#39;s had missteps I would love to see what they say is back to the best of Battlefield which is three and four I kind of agree I also really like bad company and Battlefield 2 but hey there&#39;s definitely some opportunity it seems like EA is investing quite a lot into it this time around so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see where it goes next up it has happened begun the PO World Nintendo Wars have yes Nintendo and the Pokemon company have officially announced they&#39;re intend to sue world uh the creators pocket pair uh have apparently now been wrapped up in uh a patent infringement lawsuit seeking and I quote injunctions and damages on the grounds that pow World infringes multiple patent rights interestingly most notably is that it it&#39;s not a copyright lawsuit it is a patent lawsuit but notoriously uh that is kind of tricky in the world of video games because there&#39;s so much iteration and so many different like subg genres and things kind of replicating other things and only so many game mechanics have been patented we&#39;ve talked in the past about how uh the Nemesis system is but there&#39;s not like a massive amount at least as far as I know so a lot of people are speculating just what exactly how Nintendo is really going to argue their case in my opion the fact that it took this long and Nintendo really geared up I think they probably very much believe they have a case they have some ammunition or maybe maybe they don&#39;t and maybe they are just kind of doing this as more of just a you know a saber rattling type of thing according to techa the developers pocket pair don&#39;t know they&#39;re not aware of what patents they apparently infringed upon here other than like maybe it&#39;s just the idea of throwing a ball and catching creatures in it yeah I don&#39;t think this is really going to be settled quickly I see this as like a long drawn out thing that we&#39;re probably going to be talking about more hopefully it&#39;s juicy but I don&#39;t know like I do like while like on a surface level yes there is a lot of Pokemon stuff to pow world I have played and covered the game extensively and it is kind of its own thing it does a lot of different other genre stuff in it it&#39;s got a lot of survival elements of course it&#39;s got a lot of fun Builder elements weirder stuff a totally different like tone Vibe and atmosphere so like I I don&#39;t know how this is going to go down of course it doesn&#39;t come down to us it comes down to quarts and stuff and quarts are not Gamers I mean maybe they are sometimes but who knows so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see where this ends up where this goes it&#39;s kind of difficult because I am not a lawyer person I know a couple that watched though so shout out to you guys maybe you guys can help me out but but uh for now that&#39;s just the announcement we know there is like a patent lawsuit coming so we&#39;ll keep you informed in the future next up this video is sponsored by vessie if you&#39;re new around here you might not know by now vessie has been a longtime sponsor they provide comfy Dependable Footwear a variety of different shapes and styles for every type of person for working casual City Country and all their kicks are 100% waterproof this is the coolest feature because it doesn&#39;t feel like a waterproof shoe it just feels comfy cool and it makes it a little bit more adventurous when you can step fearlessly into puddles and mud you know without your socks getting soaked it&#39;s a good feeling I&#39;ve been wearing their kicks for years now I have a pair at my back door when I&#39;m ready to go outside and play with the dog on a muddy day or whatever I&#39;m always set and for something a little bit dressier uh we got the newest Courtside classic these are absolutely premium with a really nice so cool little accents a little bit of a vintage logo on the tongue again really comfortable this is just an example of like how frequently vessie just puts out really exciting stuff you should check out their site they&#39;re always launching new colors new shapes and sizes these are great because they look a little bit old school but they have modern stuff as well so if you want to check out their kicks all you got to do is click the link in the description down below or there&#39;s a QR code here it goes to vessie vessie for sponsoring this video also it&#39;s been floating around on the internet that there may possibly be a state of play from Sony next week uh no official confirmation at the time I&#39;m making this video but keep your eyes peeled it might be a possibility usually when it&#39;s heavily rumored uh it ends up being the case but we&#39;ll see uh the news circulating around this the rumors are suggesting that we may get a re-released like a PS5 version of horizon zero Dawn it&#39;s not the most surprising thing in the world even if it&#39;s not like the most exciting either but according to Jeff grub from Giant Bomb we might also see the announcement of another remaster or re-release something that&#39;s not quite as exciting as Horizon zero Dawn so that to me doesn&#39;t really mean much at all uh but who knows what other types of announcements are coming from this thing is it going to be big games is it going to be third party Studios smaller games we don&#39;t know for sure but I I just wanted to put this out here but now some stuff I want to link in the description down below some stuff you should check out uh some games releasing this week specifically Frost Punk 2 I did the before you buy review on that it is different from the first Frost punk I think some people aren&#39;t going to like that but I think what they did is they realized that you can&#39;t perfect the original game just do more of that so essentially they took a lot of the core ideas and created something bigger and newer and I&#39;ve had a lot of fun playing it also Dead Rising Deluxe remaster releases this week I think if you&#39;re a hardcore fan of Dead Rising you&#39;re going to have some nitpicks but if you&#39;re new it&#39;s cool it&#39;s fun the visuals are nice sometimes I&#39;m a little bit more picky but like I am excited at at the very least that more people are going to play Dead Rising because that original game is so unique and it really hits different also Final Fantasy 16 released on PC we did a quick look of that we did a quick before you buy just like you know seeing if it ran on our machines also God of War Ragnarok is now out on PC as of right now Steam Reviews are sitting at kind of mixed seems like people are having some issues running it but check it out but yeah with that running that good night good luck also uh Plucky Squire released this week got a great visual Style unique spin on platforming I really want to find time to get my hands on this uh so yeah also two other new things I&#39;m going to link a couple of previews for Dragon Age the vilard uh people got to play a few hours of this and I&#39;m surprised the response is actually pretty positive I say surprised just because like this game has been so long in the works and like you just worry about BioWare and their their last couple of misfires so to hear that this might actually be a decent RPG or like action RPG you know that&#39;s nice we&#39;ll still have to wait and see how the final release shakes out but yeah I link some previews in the description also they just announced a new yakaza game again like the yakaza at this point just the train keeps rolling it never stops there&#39;s always something and this one is insane this is like a dragon pirate Yakuza in Hawaii the okay awesome I&#39;m in it&#39;s majima awesome I&#39;m even more in this is releasing at the end of February 2025 so you have something fun to play in the winter season if you&#39;re around here and uh yeah the funny thing about this one is that this actually technically leaked a couple of months back but I&#39;ve seen some people say this I didn&#39;t come up with this but like the idea is that it sounded so ridiculous that people didn&#39;t believe it or think it was true but now here we are also in some more kind of entertainment news I usually always kind of end with this Netflix Came Out Swinging with a bunch of stuff first of all they announced that we&#39;re getting more cyberpunk anime I think that&#39;s good news because Edge Runners was awesome I think it showed a lot of promise and I guess clearly they also see that there&#39;s like a lot of opportunity to just continue highlighting that world and all the random people that live in night City and just how crazy and shitty things can get they also dropped a trailer for Arcane season 2 I&#39;ll admit I have not watched Arcane I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s the best thing in the world so now we&#39;re getting a second season and you get a look at that here also uh the Devil May Cry Netflix anime this is led by ADI Shankar and it looks really crazy interestingly enough and like when I heard it in the trailer I was like wait what and it is official yes you&#39;re hearing it right Johnny Yang BOS is doing the voice of Dante here of course he is the voice actor behind Nero in the Devil May Cry game so a very interesting spin mixup I&#39;m curious to see where this is going to go I think there&#39;s a lot of possibility of course Devil May Cry has been around the block in terms of adaptations and media and animated stuff so I&#39;m curious to see how this one can do it differently and believe it or not we&#39;ve heard about it for a long time it&#39;s been in the works so now we got our first look at the Splinter Cell animated show it is called Splinter Cell Death Watch and we get a small brief little tease here a look at Sam fiser and his voice it&#39;s leev shriber Ray Donovan Sabertooth a million other characters I don&#39;t have time to list but I am GNA so as the Splinter Cell annoying guy and Michael Ironside Fanboy look if we can&#39;t get Michael Ironside as the voice I think this is an inspired choice I actually think this sounds pretty good like obviously it is so hard it&#39;s like Nathan Drake without Nolan North but I think this is a good choice where Blacklist as much as like I like the game the voice actor just did not fit Sam at all I still think it&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t get Ironside here but shriber I think is a cool choice but we&#39;ll just have to see if the show is even worth anybody&#39;s time there&#39;s some good people behind it I&#39;m hoping for the best I&#39;m just happy to have something Splinter Cell but again the jury&#39;s still out so many animated video game shows is crazy there&#39;s more they showed more of the Tomb Raider show as well with Netflix there&#39;s a lot to eat so for now speaking of that I need to go eat lunch that&#39;s all the gaming news that has been going on this week of course it&#39;s all Linked In the description down below if you want to read more but let me know in the comments what you think about everything the ps6 uh AMD thing seemingly being pretty much official the leaks rumors about the S so uh but also the PO World stuff and the lawsuit do you think that has any weight what do you want or expect from the next Battlefield game also uh you know of everything releasing this week Dead Rising Plucky Squire stuff like that Frost Punk 2 or if you&#39;re playing something older let us know let us know what you&#39;re playing uh there&#39;s going to be a pinned comment of course down there so use that thread to just reply let us know what you&#39;re playing just so we can kind of know and gauge your interest on stuff for future videos but that&#39;s really it uh I got to get back to work a lot of other upcoming games to check out so keep your eyes peeled for before he buys for the next few weeks but that&#39;s it clicking the like button helps us thank you if you like it getting caught up on the news here every single week you can also follow me on Twitter Instagram and YouTube and other places at Jake baldino but really that&#39;s it thank you guys for watching have a great weekend be

Here are some of our favorites.\nSubscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/gameranxTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#EldenRing\n\n10. Spirit-caller Snail - ROAD'S END CATACOMBS, found in eastern Liurnia south of the minor Erdtree\n\n9. Starscourge Radahn - found in Redmane Castle, in the Southern part of Caelid\n\n8. Godskin Apostle - Dominula, Windmill Village which is on the northern edge of the Altus Region\n\n7. Patches - found in Murkwater cave in the center of Limgrave, look for a cave entrance in the ravine filled with skeletons\n\n6. Mimic Tear - found in Nokron, which can only be accessed after defeating Starscourge Radahn and going down the giant hole in Limgrave formed by his comet, which is in South of Mistwood\n\n5. Wormface - the guardian of the Minor Erdtree at the center of Altus in the forest area\n\n4. Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella - Found by exploring the ainsel river region, which can be accessed in the Liurnia region from the Ainsel River Well north of the Liurnia Divine tower\n\n3. Ancestor Spirit - found by lighting the fires at all of the monuments in the Siofra River area then going to Hallowhorn hall and interacting with the corpse. The area can be accessed from the Siofra River Well, which is found near the Minor Erdtree in Limgrave, in the mistwood forest.\n\n2. Ryckard - Found in the Volcano Manor at the top of Mt. Gelmir, which is in the western part of Atlus. Can only be accessed if you agree to help Lady Tanith and complete the questline there, a secret door can be found in the first room to the right after you've made enough progress with the quest. Kill the people she wants you to kill and talk to everyone and it should unlock.\n\n1. Astel - Found in the River of Rot, an area that can only be accessed by making a certain amount of progress in Ranni's Questline, which is too complicated to explain here - \nhttps://gameranx.com/features/id/290315/article/elden-ring-how-to-enter-the-lake-of-rot-secret-area-guide/\n\nBONUS \n\nMalenia - Found in Miquella's Haligtree, a location that can only be reached by finding 2 parts of the Haligtree Secret Medallion. 1 is found in Castle Sol in the Mountaintop of the Giants and one is in the Village of the Albinaurics, a town build under a mountain to the west in Liurnia. There's a villager disguised as a pot hiding there: attack them to reveal the ruse and talk to them to get 1 half of the haligtree secret medallion. When you have both you get an alternate option at the Grand Lift of Rold that takes you to the Consecrated Snowfield and eventually the Haligtree.",
