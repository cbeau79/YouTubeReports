      "subtitles": "let&#39;s step back to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century and let&#39;s Steelman the case for communism let&#39;s put ourselves in the shoes of the people there not in this way we can we can look back at what happened in the 20th century why was this such a compelling notion for millions of people uh can we make the case for it well clearly it was a compelling case for millions of people and and part of this story has to do with uh overall has to do with the faith conviction stories of uh of people sacrificing themselves as well as their countrymen uh in a cause that they believed was uh not just legitimate but uh demanded their total obedience I think that throughout the early part of the 20th century uh late 19th century early part of the 20th century so much of the compelling case for communism came from the confidence that people in the west more generally placed in science the notion that science is answering problems science is giving us solutions to how the world around us Works how the world around us can be improved um some varieties of that and I watch the quotation mark science were crazy right like phenology so-called scientific racism that tried to divide Humanity up in into uh discret blocks uh and to manipulate them in ways that were allegedly scientific or rational so there were Horrors that followed from uh those invocations of science but its Prestige was enormous and that in part had to do with uh the uh lessening grip of religious ideas on intellectual Elites more generally processes of secularization not total secularization but but processes of secularization in in Western industrial societies um and the sense that here&#39;s a doctrine that will allow escape from Wars brought on by capitalist competition poverty and economic cycles and depressions brought on by capitalist competition uh the inequalities uh of societies that remain hierarchical and class-based uh and this claim to being cuttingedge science I think allows people like Lenin to derive immense confidence in the prescription that they have for the future and that paradoxically the confidence that you have in Broad Strokes the right set of answers for how to get to the Future also allows you to take huge liberties with the tactics and the strategies that you follow as long as your ultimate goal remains the one sketched by this this master plan so um you know ultimately some of the predictions of someone like Lenin that that once Society has reached that stage of the dictatorship of the of the proletariat the notion that governments will essentially be able to run themselves and the model he had in mind oddly enough was Swiss post office offices being in Swiss Exile must have impressed him so much with the orderliness and the sheer discipline and rationality of a Swiss post office and he thought why can&#39;t you organize governments like this where you don&#39;t need political leaders you don&#39;t need Grand Visions you have procedures you have bureaucracy which does its job in a way that&#39;s not alienating but simply produces the the greatest good uh you know when you think of experiences with bureaucracy in the 20th century one&#39;s hair stands on end to have you know the the the comparative navite uh on display with a prediction like that but it deres from that confidence that it&#39;s all going to be okay because we understand we have the key we have the plan to how to arrive uh at this this uh this final uh configuration of humanity yeah the certainty of Science in quotes and and uh the goal of Utopia gets you in trouble but also just on the human level from um from a workingclass person perspective from the Industrial Revolution you see the growing inequality wealth inequality and there is a kind of you see people getting wealthy and combined with the fact that life is difficult life in general life is suffering for many for most for all if you listen to some philosophers and there is kind of a a powerful idea in that the man is exploiting me and that&#39;s a populous message that a lot of people resonate with because to a degree is true in every system and so before you kind of know how these economic and political uh ideas manifest themselves it is really powerful to say here Beyond the Horizon there&#39;s a world where the rich man will not exploit my hard work anymore and I think that&#39;s a really powerful idea it is I mean at the same time though it kind of points to uh you know a further problem and that&#39;s the identity of the revolutionaries um it it turned out that uh many of these revolutionary movements uh and then the founding Elites of communist countries uh in the aftermath of the the Soviet seizure of power um turn out to be something quite different from people who have spent their lives in factories experiencing the Industrial Revolution firsthand I me there&#39;s a special role here for intellectuals uh and um when when marks and angles right into the Communist Manifesto the notion that certain exceptional individuals can rise above their class origins in a way other people can&#39;t and transcend their earlier role their their materially determined role in order to gain a perspective on the historical process as a whole and AE themselves with a working class and its struggle for communism this sort of special role that they carved out for themselves is enormously appealing for intellectuals because any celebration of intellectuals as World movers is going to appeal to intellectuals uh that that um Gap that um that frequent reality of not being in touch with uh the very classes that the uh Communists are aiming to represent uh is is a very frequent theme in uh in this story uh it also um speaks to a crucial part of this story which is the breaking apart or the Civil War the war of brother against brother the Fraternal struggle that splits socialism and splits followers of Marx and that&#39;s in the uh aftermath of the the first world war in particular uh or or during the this traumatic experience the way in which uh Lenin encourages the foundation of radical parties that will break with social democracy of the sort that had been elaborated especially in places like Germany uh scorning their moderation and instead announcing a new dispensation which was the leninist conception of a disciplined hardcore of professional revolutionaries who will act in ways that uh that a mere Trade union movement couldn&#39;t and what this speaks to is you know a fundamental tension in uh in radical movements because uh left to their own devices Lenin uh announces workers tend to focus on their reality their families their workplace want better working conditions unionize and then aim to negotiate with employers or to agitate for reforms on the part of the state to improve their living conditions and then are happy for the advances that they have won and for lennin that&#39;s not enough because that&#39;s a half measure that&#39;s the sort of thing that leads you into an accommodation with the system rather than the overthrow of the system so there&#39;s a real there&#39;s a constant tension uh in in in this regard that plays itself out over the Long Haul e"

      "subtitles": "so let&#39;s go to uh Lenin and the Russian Revolution how did uh communism come to power in the Soviet Union it came to power as a result of stepping into a power vacuum and the power vacuum was created by the first world war and it&#39;s the the effect that it had as a total war unprecedented pressure placed on a regime that in many ways uh was a a traditional almost feudal monarchy uh only experiencing the beginnings of the modernization that uh the rest of Europe had undergone the uh and for this reason communism comes to power in a place that Marx probably wouldn&#39;t have expected in the wreckage wreckage of the Russian Empire uh Lenin is absolutely vital to this equation because uh he&#39;s the one who presses the process forward uh ironically um given the claim of communist leaders to having the key to history uh just a few months previous in Exile in Switzerland Lenin had been despairing and been convinced that uh that that he&#39;s not may not even live to see the Advent of that day but then when Revolution does break out in uh the Russian Empire uh in February of 1917 Lenin is absolutely frantic to get back and when he does get back as a result of a deal that is negotiated with the German High command a step that they they&#39;ll later live very much to regret uh he is able to get back and to go into action and to press for nothing less than the seizure of power uh that brings uh the his Bolshevik faction the radical uh wing of the Socialist movement uh to power in and then to build the Soviet Union so even he was surprised how effective and how fast the revolution happened he was although I think that he would have uh would have agreed that what was necessary was a cataclysm on the scale of the first world war to make this happen um the first world war shatters so many of the certainties of the 19th century that we talked about as a as a dynamic period with argument between ideologies it it scrambles all sorts of early debates it renegotiates the status of the individual versus an all powerful State and the claims of the state because to win or even just to survive in World War I you need to centralize centralize centralize uh and to uh put everything onto a authoritarian wartime footing in country after country uh so Lenin uh earlier had already articulated the possibility that this might happen happen by talking about how the entire Globe already was connected uh and there&#39;s a a chain of capitalist development that is connecting different countries so that the weakest link in the chain if it breaks if it pops open uh it might actually uh inaugurate much bigger processes uh and uh start a chain reaction and that&#39;s what he intended to do and has the chance to do uh in the course of 1917 um incidentally just to get a a sense of the sheer chaos and the um the human on an individual human level what the absence of uh established Authority meant uh there&#39;s there&#39;s few works of literature that are as powerful as Baris pasak Dr jivago for giving just the whole sweep of contending for forces uh in a power vacuum uh it&#39;s an amazing testimony to that time and place so you said uh that Bolshevik saw violence and Terror as necessary so C can you just speak to this aspect of their because they took power and and so this this was a part of the way they saw the world right and it had antecedence um even though Lenin and his colleagues are competing amongst each other for the title of most faithful disciple of Marx and and most true to the received uh theory in in practice there&#39;s other influences earlier influences that operate in the Russian context uh that were not operative let&#39;s say on the German context and here you have to step back and think about the nature of tsarism which had maintained still uh into the 20th century the notion of a divine right to rule that God had ordained uh the Tara system and uh its hierarchies and that to question these was was sinful and politically not advisable and the restrictive nature of Russian Society at this point dominated by The tarist Establishment its harshness its reactionary nature meant that people who in another context in another country might have been reformers could instead very easily be provoked into becoming reol evolutionaries uh and Lenin is a perfect example of this because his uh older brother uh was executed as a result of being in a uh radical revolutionary movement uh that was who was arrested and executed for uh association with terrorism um and earlier generations of Russian radicals had uh founded populist groups that would aim to engage in terrorism and resistance against the tarist regime um and this included uh people who call themselves neols and these neols were materialists who saw themselves um ushering in uh a new age by absolute rejection of earlier religious Traditions uh and aiming for material answers to uh the the challenges of the day uh among them was Nikolai chesi who wrote uh what&#39;s been called the worst book ever written it was in fact one of Lennon&#39;s favorite books it in Russian it&#39;s stel in English it gets translated what is to be done and it&#39;s a utopian novel about uh revolutionaries and how revolutionaries should act with one another in open ways new ways non-traditional ways in order to help usher in the the coming Revolution Lenin loved the work and said it had the great Merit of showing you how to be a revolutionary so there&#39;s the Marxist influence and then there&#39;s Russian populist neist influence which uh um is also a very live current in in Lenin&#39;s thinking and when you add these things together you get a an explosive mix because Lenin as a result and part of this family trauma of his brother becomes a absolutely irreconcilable enemy of of the tarist regime and sets about turning himself into what you might call a guided missile for revolution he turns himself into a machine to produce revolutionary change and I I mean that with little hyperbole Lennon at one point shared with friends that he loved listening to music but he tried not to listen to beautiful music like Beethoven because it made him feel gentle what the revolution demanded was realism hardness absolute Steely resolve so Lenin um worries even fellow revolutionaries by the intensity of his single-minded Focus to Revolution he spends his days thinking about the revolution he probably dreamt about the revolution uh and so 247 it&#39;s an existence where he&#39;s paired off other um human elements quite deliberately in order to turn himself into an effective uh instigator of Revolution so when the opportunity comes in 1917 he&#39;s primed and and ready uh for that role"

      "subtitles": "so as a historian let me ask you for advice what advice would you give on interviewing world leaders whether it&#39;s people who who are no longer here some of the people we&#39;ve been talking about Hitler Stalin ma or people that are still here Putin zalinsky Trump KLA Harris Netanyahu siin ping as a historian like what is it possible to have an interesting conversation maybe as a thought experiment what what kind of conversation would you like to have with Hitler in the 1930s or Stalin in the 1920s well first of all I mean the answer is very clear I would never presume to advise you about uh interviewing world leaders uh and prominent people because the the roster that you&#39;ve accumulated is just astonishing so but I I know what what I might aim for and that is I think um in historical analysis in trying to understand the role of a particular leader the more one understands about their prior background and formative influences the better a fix I think one gets on the question of what are their expectations what is the in German there&#39;s a a beautiful word for this Germans managed to ma Mash together several words into into one even better word and in German it&#39;s the Horizon of expectation so um in the case of figures like Churchill or Hitler their experience of World War I shaped their actions in World War II uh their values were shaped in their childhood is there a way of engaging with someone you&#39;re interviewing even obliquely that gives a view in on their sense of what the future might hold and I mean that obviously such people are expert at being guarded and not being pinned down but the categories in which they&#39;re thinking uh a sense of what their what their own ethical grounding might be or their ethical code that gives hints to their behavior it gets said and again it&#39;s a cliche because it&#39;s true that one of the best measures of a person especially a leader is how they treat people from whom they don&#39;t expect anything uh are they condescending are they on the contrary fundamentally interested in another person even if that person can&#39;t help them or be used in some way um you know speaking of of prominent world leaders to interview uh there&#39;s Napoleon Napoleon psychologically must have been a quite amazing person to make a bid for Mastery of Europe and then already thinking about the Mastery of the the world but contemporaries who met Napoleon said that it was very disturbing to talk with him because meeting with him one-on-one revealed that he could talk to you but look like he was looking right through you as if you were not fully real you were more in the nature of a character on a chessboard and for that reason some of them called Napoleon the master of the sightless stair so if you&#39;re talking with a world leader and he or she has a sightless stare that&#39;s probably a bad sign but there might be other inadvertent clues or hints about the moral compass or the future expectations uh of a leader that emerge in one of your wonderful conversations yeah you you put it brilliantly in several ways but the moral compass getting sneaking up to the the full nuance and complexity of the moral compass and one of the ways of doing that is looking at the various Horizons in time about their vision of the future I imagine it&#39;s possible to get Hitler to talk about the future of the Third Reich and to see in in ways like what he actually envisions that as and similar with Stalin but of course funny enough I believe those leaders would be easier to talk to because there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of in terms of political competition um modern leaders are a little bit more guarded because they have to they they have uh opposition often to contend with constituencies in constituencies"
