house next door this guy&#39;s a freaking criminal for sure here&#39;s the thing when we ask people for submissions please feel a little bit of Shame before you just submit that one&#39;s rough Nathan I&#39;m really disappointed why did you put your TV off center holy crap that sucks they were like oh I need the door to open so that to mount these right at the ceiling they got the subwoofer here they got a nice Center these towers are expensive yeah and just truly collection of the worst board games of all time Cards Against Humanity The Game of Life Monopoly Major League Baseball Edition Cards Against Humanity appeals to people who have always wanted to be funny but never have been I love this this is a cool setup this is a good one this one looks like I don&#39;t know is this the computer when you have guests over you put them here is that a stock Windows background yep that is a stock Windows background personalized NPC NPC ass background this is a nice set like why this is another one of those things like did just put it up there for the video like there&#39;s no how you would have never done that one wire no one would have done that they would have just gone oh that&#39;s up there done like even if you didn&#39;t cable manage it where is this how what the hell is going on is this the same person he&#39;s got the chungus water bottle another mousemat and the W mouse mat which you can get at LTT store.com I like I like the $30,000 amp $400 Bluetooth headset oh wait yeah where are the headphones that go with that or are they these oh sorry are these they well how many calls are you taking dude I wonder how much I bet you this guy&#39;s a scam caller that&#39;s how he makes this money your bedroom setup sucks yeah just remove your bedroom setup is trash don&#39;t include that photo next time all the rest fix your bedroom setup you clearly know how that&#39;s that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the worst part is you know how you have the skills you&#39;ve done it multiple times before this sucks whoa that&#39;s a monitors this looks like a JPEG of a garbage can this doesn&#39;t look you know what I&#39;m saying there&#39;s like a Twitter account that just says low poly food in video games that 100% would be on that Twitter account like you&#39;re looking at it too closely the whole thing is flat for some reason I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on there that&#39;s weird F have they just been crushing beers just looking yep y yeah this was in the middle of a sesh they even got the cooler this is oh man they wanted to go fishing but it started raining so they went and ordered takeout and they got all their dips oh you wipe your ass on that nice uh it&#39;s Wednesday it is Wednesday be so much happier I can ignore the stained carpet bunch of audio stuff that&#39;s the name of the brand some Stacks dude this guy&#39;s really interest I legitimately what they&#39;re called yeah this is a fire hazard this is a l this is this is how you die uh the cable management under the desk is insanely better than the cable management on top of the desk that&#39;s rare which is very rare who&#39;s that cutie oh hello were you watching setup doctor on both setups hold on so you&#39;re watching setup doctor here and you didn&#39;t think that was sing hard enough so you had to watch it on this computer too uh this is really great for ventilation on the PlayStation 4 put on top of a bunch of underwear um it&#39;s also just a bad spot to have your underwear [Music] yeah ew ew is that underwear pick your socks up that&#39;s a those are scrunchies they they L foot they blurred their foot that was smart person is educated on how the internet works okay that&#39;s a nice setup that&#39;s classy I like the full size pink this is Chill AF yeah very pink I like it got some cable management to do and dear goodness clean up your floor like what a lot of scrunchies and just there&#39;s also clearly like liquid was spilled here at one point there&#39;s detrus of sorts this cable just yeah it&#39;s not even plugged in it&#39;s in like it&#39;s an original wrap it has the the plug protectors on it it has the like twisty tie thinger around you bought it you went to plug it in you&#39;re like oh okay yeah I&#39;m done you belong on the floor now all right what&#39;s next is this blurred yeah so the fact that you took the time to blur it but not remove it from the photo yeah just move it Blow desk fine that&#39;s just cables it&#39;s so close to Greatness yeah you do so well it makes it so much more frustrating got some wuss I&#39;m I&#39;m better now you you&#39;re healed there&#39;s anim did these heal you yeah very nice good for you so that this is hooked up to the same computer oh oh that&#39;s pretty cool oh zoom out is that a table sideways did you just use that to cover the cables on the floor you monster you monster why would you do that they had at one point it&#39;s not being used anymore so they knew it was a thing they should do at one point this is a pretty sick setup yeah this is clean up your scrunchies and you get a 10 yeah oh 360 shot yo this is sick as heck that fan is so big this gu was at LTX 2023 represent I like that we got like a retro area with the old IM oh I love those beautiful I like this CD art too CRT of some sort that&#39;s an iMac cut that cut that for the love of God cut that what is he making why is he doing this why are you making lus smile I don&#39;t like it what are you doing what are you doing in projecting lonus in 3D space somehow uh this is It&#39;s just somebody&#39;s room they it work yeah Nate good setup good room yeah great great room damn yeah like that is a nice desk I like the plywood a man after lonus his own heart playing ano 1800 drinking a Twisted Tea single Twisted with the with the graphing calculator hell yeah yeah this guy this guy lives a life of some sort big basement energy yeah absolutely but making the most out of it I love the uh the ethernet going through the ceiling it&#39;s still okay that&#39;s not that bad come on you made you put the point of the other cables you could put that one up put the Twisted DT down for a second fix fix this they nicely manage that one cable up and around and the other one there&#39;s like a it we put on the floor holy crap did you buy like damn damn what you buy a ker of C ethernet cable holy what&#39;s the Wi-Fi password oh here just give me a second runs downstairs and Brak like just plug into this I think you&#39;re about H 26 and A2 feet away all right yeah it&#39;s a cool setup I don&#39;t mind it the ethernet runs could be a bit better there&#39;s nothing happening here I can&#39;t help but notice iMed the caes sometimes I give people more of a pass when they have more stuff going on this is why there&#39;s nothing going on so you can&#39;t have your four messy cables or whatever it is because that&#39;s all that looks at immediately what we see I like how you have uh you&#39;re nice carpet protector sadly it did not protect this stain from happening grow weed no it&#39;s not weed look like weed I&#39;m joking I don&#39;t grow it myself neither do I but why why do you think well it&#39;s it&#39;s [Music] green editor cut all of this let&#39;s just move on what your dog looks absolutely Terri terrified your dog looks like he&#39;s going to die you&#39;ve cornered him got the lotion on the bed yeah like glad you moved it off your desk and he was me wow okay man it doesn&#39;t matter you just don&#39;t worry about it okay like you it&#39;s the moment you get over it the moment you realize that it it didn&#39;t mean anything in the past okay trust me I&#39;ve been [Music] there wow okay so he&#39;s got this diagram that I don&#39;t care about I okay I was going to say I don&#39;t care about your network diagram but then Luke was very excited so I&#39;ll let you go KVM setup yeah this is legit and it&#39;s a desktop and laptop KVM setup this is sick this is very cool this is cool that&#39;s not cool that&#39;s way way why does that always happen every time it&#39;s always the next the next picture this guy has a server rack but couldn&#39;t afford a table to put his printer on it just sits on the floor what why is the soundar just there by a table listen you can find furniture for free really easily anywhere it&#39;s just not that hard you have no excuse to have both of your printers on the ground just put you have a rack I don&#39;t know rack about just put a table there this monitor arm is crying it&#39;s like oh God I&#39;m trying so hard get old the waight of it please yeah this person needs to spend all of the money that they very clearly have on a nicer desk yeah and maybe some artwork I don&#39;t know like a single art cool setup technically on the on that side you just need to take care of the kale mag is what kind of splooge stain is that yeah what is that this is taken on my 2004 Canon personal handheld camera see this person has an excuse for not having a table cuz they they haven&#39;t wasted their money on a fancy camera or like a nice monitor couldn&#39;t hold still for your image Star Wars Lego I feel like the investment is interesting here looking at the desk that they have versus the probably like $800 worth of Star Wars Lego I like how they got again priorities the cheapest AliExpress desk plus the largest Lego set I have seen in my damn life look at that box they clearly bought the like death star that&#39;s like $800 yeah and they&#39;re just using it as a stand they&#39;re not even like oh yeah it&#39;s an investment because like Lego goes up in value no they&#39;re just like they just don&#39;t understand how good it could be to have a real table that&#39;s one of those like calm you down Bowl things whatever they&#39;re called oh are you like yeah yeah one of those yeah yeah this is nice we got we got we got a stack we got a wireless charger oh they got pke audio this is like kind of a nice setup yep and big Fen but they take care of it yeah got some nice little figurines this seems like a really good setup are you happy now hi Barry this is your this satisfies you no cuz it&#39;s not in my room don&#39;t include that editor wipe your walls what are you doing the the feets they need a clean you can tell that this guy has like really dry feet cuz it&#39;s like scraping the side like the paint off of it it&#39;s just oh my God don&#39;t zoom in wash your feet stop change it wash your feet how much how much would it take for you to lick it h five bucks but besides the dirty feet this is a really nice spot like yeah this is a good basement I like how you have a vent instead of a window that&#39;s pretty chill you know overall like it&#39;s a nice setup why did you submit it to get fixed it doesn&#39;t need it this person loves wasting money hell yeah this is my type of set up we&#39;re figurine maxing woo sorry sorry you okay over there I got to stop looking copious amounts of manga copious amounts of figurines look at the size of that one in the bottom right of that case that is not cheap okay I am not at all surprised at the Final Fantasy n Walker background given um all of this stuff uh all of this stuff uh I like it this stuff uh pretty much everything around here and uh the mouse pad and everything else the N Walker background just totally it fits in makes sense I like it this person does not know what savings are this person has never heard of a tax shelter this person has the impulse control of a three-year-old boy okay oh my God so much money is there two computers as well and a screen on the front of their computer oh my God so they have also met someone that is equally irresponsible wow they&#39;re enabling each other I do love the neon curvy that&#39;s not lit up oh and they even have a place to touch grass I like the honey I&#39;m going to buy something I&#39;m going to buy it I&#39;m going to buy it babe babe look babe the grass is right there touch grass it&#39;s just to remind you every so often that is cheating by the way you do not get credit for touching grass if you touch your wall I like this setup buddy here probably makes an obscene amount of money yeah sis admin on the left sis admin for sure if he decides to quit it the entire infrastructure of a company is just completely leaving well Kevin I hope you make lots of money if not make better decisions overall this is really nice though like I appreciate the art in the background I like how we&#39;ve murdered grou for crimes against humanity looks like he&#39;s hang baby Yoda holy sorry to hear that maybe you don&#39;t murder children aliens down here the desk has taken damage yeah what are you doing when what are you doing they&#39;re playing the brain teaser game they&#39;re like those damn sandpaper shirts you know yeah the whole every why did they send us two photos that&#39;s it there&#39;s only these two I&#39;m mad that that makes me more mad than any set up so stupid why why would you submit two photos the exact same rough moving on I&#39;m you deserve no more and if you want to watch more roasts like this you can see extras for this very video on flow.com you need to go there right this is a real living at my desk kind of scenario we got the metal Chopsticks we got the lotion we got the hand sany we got is it a 3D printed top part of a mug is it 3D printed mug for pacing yourself the lube the lube that&#39;s the lube baby certified goon these pictures are so close what is it ah thank you this look is that&#39;s a that&#39;s a foot input that&#39;s like a foot pad oh my God that thing that is the most sweatiest that&#39;s like a sweaty 2008 csgo player whoa wow this immediately became the maximalist of maximalist setups buddy&#39;s got a lot of stuff like a lot of stuff like a whole lot of stuff I hope this person doesn&#39;t live anywhere near where earthquakes happen cuz they are dead the moment an earthquake hits we&#39;ve got a headphone holder here which is not being used at all and we&#39;ve got like a dozen turkey trays this person literally this is this is definitely I live here what is this are they trying to tell us something oh that&#39;s the submission for the nice nice yeah it was okay you made the best of what set some of these May me angry I&#39;m not angry I&#39;m not angry now on to Matt who has a 3D printer apparently yeah and he doesn&#39;t use it had a 3D printer now he has a mass this is horrible this sucks yeah please go home what is what is anything here yeah the stack of hard drive holy crap that&#39;s a lot of hard drives yeah that&#39;s a lot of hard drives how big are they twoo only two terabytes so that&#39;s not too insane I don&#39;t even know if I want to say I think I want them to fall over I think I think they need to learn from this and it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to be that bad of a lesson cuz they&#39;re 2 ter hard drives this man pirates for sure I think it needs to there needs to be something that happens from I&#39;m so mad at this someone needs to bump this desk this person needs to learn to never do this again he got another hard dve another hard drive somebody tell this man about ssds please what is the fan taped to the top of his power supply that is so good these are our viewers meaning they&#39;ve probably watched us build a computer and know what to not do and what to do I have mounted drives in weird sketchy ways out of almost necessity before I think this is just laziness I think this could have fit in the computer this person&#39;s like it works 100% well I mean clearly that&#39;s what they would say uh I I really hate this I also like how not stereo the speaker setup is it&#39;s not oh I think that&#39;s a nice part about mov movable pairs if you want the mono experience you&#39;re tired of The Beatles having the drums all the way in one ear you can just go here and then you feel great this man this man eating his Skittles with a fork oh LT water bottle so there&#39;s more hard drives that we didn&#39;t originally see on the other side of the stack and the hard Drive Bays that are in the computer are empty I&#39;m fuming I&#39;m really mad I just don&#39;t get it overall like decent setup but could definitely use just a little bit of a tidy not a big tidy no I could use a big tidy this needs a big tidy this guy needs to prioritize he also needs a mous pad oh that&#39;s beautiful the window you got that a brown this is amazing what holy crap this is incredible oh separate numpad after my own heart a separate numpad on the right side be on their Mouse this is a person of absolute culture they deserve no reduction in points for anything right now let&#39;s go to the next photo there&#39;s got to be more I don&#39;t know okay there [Music] was this is rough it wasn&#39;t worth trying to get some free cable management to to to you know when you could have just claimed this and then now everyone knows you have this as well I like the like full desk desk pad that&#39;s kind of cool it can be it can be a little bit more complicated find a desk pad that actually matches your whole desk cables are big oof Omega R those are going to be right by your feet you&#39;re probably like you&#39;re probably just like playing with it they did this this needs some help why you made it worse by tying whatever to it you&#39;ve made it so much worse the cables that are stretched around just to touch that thing cut off the end of your zip ties please I don&#39;t think the table leg is the right move here I appreciate that you all the way at the bottom of the table for like 17 seconds thought about doing cable management and then abandon it but you should come back to the topic ew it&#39;s so hairy why is it so hairy I really hope that they have a dog that legitimately looks like dead like Daddy Long Legs yeah that&#39;s pretty gross dude also like look at the CPU Cooler yuck yeah that&#39;s see better days you should take that off you should just get a different CPU Cooler if you&#39;re running a 3080 I don&#39;t know what CPU you have but it probably wants more cooling than thaty oh the computer&#39;s dented do you see it the very top did you drop your computer D that may be why the side panel&#39;s not on nice little console setup here we got when you get the green Xbox they even have their verification can there this corner is like presistin that&#39;s really nice this is really out of nowhere this is super nice dude that Xbox looks so good that is incredibly sick I really wish I had this Halo 3 helmet I have one of those this is super sick this is a really cool area I I I Vibe I do as well wa whoo look at that Pikachu N64 damn okay that&#39;s actually sick that&#39;s so cool that totally makes up for the copious amount of Funko Pops you up honestly disappointed yeah I&#39;m pretty mad that this as our audience could have done better we need to take some amount of responsibility for this I think yeah cuz you guys learned from us people you&#39;ve learned their their actions reflect on on us to a certain degree I&#39;m sorry you know just get help like we do from our sponsor jlc PCB jlc PCB is a great affordable choice for electronic Engineers prototyping pcbs they offer a lightning fast turnaround

      "subtitles": "welcome to the W show we&#39;ve got a great show lined up for you today the big news this week is of course that YouTube is changing for the better for the worse maybe some combination of the two uh we&#39;ll be talking about it and I was here in person at Creator Summit where they told us not just what&#39;s going on but also some of the reasoning behind it uh we&#39;re also going to be talking about ah yes of course Nintendo&#39;s long overdue lawsuit against pal world for a copyright INF no no it&#39;s not copyright infringement it&#39;s something else entirely literally nobody saw this coming what else we got Luke Linux Gamers can no longer play GTA 5 but in other news there&#39;s changes to anti-che which is what we&#39;re talking about there which might benefit everyone also benefit people whoaaa whoa whoa whoa who whoa whoa whoa okay no no we&#39;re breaking up the format explain yourself no no I&#39;m kidding not breaking up the format okay one more one more one more teaser pleas have me scroll away uh the ryzen 9000 launch it&#39;s not going well it&#39;s not it&#39;s not good yeah it&#39;s not not not not good yeah you have to roll the intro Loop me is it not in the thing do I press here I&#39;m yeah come on come on you got it where is it it&#39;s on the top right there I thought it was in the dashboard just the outros the [Music] out the show is brought to you today by vessie Corsair and ug green and of course our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner LG neither of whom I am using right now now unfortunately uh any who why don&#39;t we jump right into our headline topic wait wait no you are you are it&#39;s right here I am yeah your your avatar is in front of an LG laptop and sitting in a secret La chair look at me typing look at me typing on my LG gram and sitting in my secret lab chair that you can&#39;t even see the back of because I am in front of it with this wall that is the attached to the back of my head covers everything behind me yeah problem let&#39;s jump right into our headline topic here which is YouTube is changing whether it&#39;s for the better or the worse well we&#39;ll leave that up to you but first why don&#39;t we go through the sweet of new features that they announced on at made on YouTube several of which are AI powered first up we&#39;ve got dream screen which makes still and moving backgrounds for YouTube shorts and will now use the newest version of Google deep Minds text to video generator vo vo will allow for more realistic backgrounds as well as the ability to edit and remix previously generated content in the first half of the Year dream screen will be able to generate entire six second clips from scratch okay so why don&#39;t we why don&#39;t we unpack this one first we can we can kind of go through one by one um Luke thought generation of still in moving backgrounds for YouTube shorts uh I don&#39;t think this is necessarily super new in the still backgrounds sense is you could have done this with a variety of tools already that already exist the moving background sense is interesting I believe the average short is about 30 seconds if I remember correctly um so you&#39;re going to need five of these to be able to actually stitch together one whole short um honestly I don&#39;t think the impact of this is going to be super extensive unless you start getting people um like fake reporting like saying they&#39;re on the scene somewhere and the background is that place and it&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re actually there or not um which could be problematic I personally uh am having a hard time imagining uh why this would be good for well why don&#39;t you throw up why don&#39;t you throw up the examples why don&#39;t you throw up the the examp I&#39;ve got those here your your uh big face is in front of them um but this is this is the video this is the video this is what it would be like this is what it would be like you generate the background and then you just got your face with kind of like a badly thing in front of it yeah so I guess okay this is perfect this is definitely a better experience yeah sorry carry on the concerns that I&#39;ve had are are not really I gu no the example says dreamlike so it&#39;s intentionally trying to not be realistic honestly that feels like a calculated move um yeah because they they they don&#39;t want to show it creating realistic like scenes I don&#39;t know um I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get these videos with text over them with an AI voice speaking some type of uh motivational junk and then that&#39;s going to get churned out 10 billion times and fill your shorts feed with with garbage and useless content um but other than that I I really I I don&#39;t know I I have a hard time seeing this creating good content that people actually want um but you know maybe I&#39;ll well here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say talking to YouTube about this so I was at Creator Summit this week um pretty cool definitely um definitely one of the highlights of my career being able to attend this kind of event I sorry nothing you&#39;re good there I am uh definitely one of the highlights of my career being able to attend events like this um I got to um I got to hang out with Michelle carry quite a bit this time around uh got to I was surprised to see Matt Pat there the rumors of his retirement have been greatly exaggerated um but Matt Pat was there which was really great to to be able to connect with him and staff um shoot now that I&#39;ve started listing people it&#39;s going to be horrible when like I forget someone that I that I hung out with for a bit but definitely hung out with hacksmith for a while it was awesome to see him um oh man now now I&#39;m going to feel now I&#39;m going to feel so bad uh and many other great and fantastic people oh dude dude I finally I finally actually met Carl Jacobs the guy that we built the $100,000 PC for i&#39; never met him and it turned out that we were we were on the same floor in the hotel H and I like didn&#39;t recognize him because I I don&#39;t watch YouTube it&#39;s always super awkward for me at these events because everyone else kind of seems to know who everyone else is because it&#39;s a top Creator Summit and so these are a lot of the the like the top creators on the platform and I I don&#39;t really watch YouTube we played a game uh late last night like 2 in the morning we were all just like sitting around a picnic table outside and everyone like brought up their their YouTube account and and showed how many of the other people at the table they were subscribed to um Michelle was literally subscribed to everyone else around the table and I pull up mine and the LT account the main LT account is subscribe to one Creator Luke do you have any guesses as to who it is if you is it is okay can I ask a question first if it was one Creator yeah yeah can tell you what you can ask free questions because you&#39;re not going to get it is it one of our own channels no is it a channel that we question previously closely affiliated with closely Affiliated I would say no no okay it&#39;s not ncx oh that&#39;s where you were going no that&#39;s a oh that was a good guess though that was a really good guess no honestly if it&#39;s not them I have a one more so we&#39;re we&#39;re not a close not closely Affiliated no it&#39;s not our own thing no you I think you could have gotten the answers to both of those with just the one I think you could yeah I was I was fishing I was fishing too hard yeah oh dude you wasted you wasted one have we ever have we ever worked with them or collabed with them or anything like that yes so you&#39;ve at least managed to narrow it down a little bit [Laughter] is it like Paul oh good guess good guess good guess but no the answer is lwig and the reason for it he wasn&#39;t there so recent I expected it to be like really old okay no the reason for it is that when I was sitting next to him literally next to him in a chair um he like guilted me a little bit that was part of it I think that happened camera but then when I was sitting next to him in the chair doing the Bro versus bro uh he was getting the stream set up and I wanted to interact with chat and I couldn&#39;t because he has like a five minute or a 10 minute subscriber gate on interacting in his live chat so I subscribes to him and then I just like never remembered to unsubscribe or I care and I never looked at it so that was it that was the one I was subscribed to hold on my personal my personal is worse okay so after that because they asked about like what about first everyone was talking about Maine right and for pretty much everyone else on Maine would be the channel they upload to right because they don&#39;t have uh like the the content management system that gives multiple people access to their uh to their uploading tools and their and their Channel management tools and stuff like we we have like eight active channels right now or something like that and we have multiple people that need access to all of them so we have kind of a different access system to our to our Chann channels so my uh like like my main channel is not at Linus Tech tips it&#39;s it&#39;s just at like my my Gmail account so so get this okay once again I was not subscribed to anybody who was at the table um you ready sure Linus Tech tips okay that makes sense probably did that at some point Dave and Ava nursery rhymes and baby something so my probably mashed that in fact it was probably my son like 10 years ago when I didn&#39;t want to get up in the morning and I was like take my phone um Lulu kids nursery rhymes and children whatever Super Simple Songs kid songs so those are all probably similar stories I am subscribed with the Bell rung to Apple Canada for some reason no idea why I&#39;m subscribed to Last Week Tonight um don&#39;t remember when I did that love John Oliver but I don&#39;t remember subscribing to that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a notification for it and then the last two you&#39;re going to laugh uh one of them is Killian experience he a totally totally random I know that reference though I know why yeah um and then the last one is the mom boys the the what the mom boys that&#39;s the remember that rap song that has Tekken on my tip yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I&#39;m so that is the list of channels I&#39;m subscribed I I don&#39;t know if you could come up with a more random list of channels if you just started like inputting letters and numbers with your face by mashing your face against your keyboard youtube.com/ mashy face against your keyboard and then just pressing enter like completely completely unrelated to each other channels um so I I lost the game um I lost that game uh which is fine I guess I forget where I was going with this but uh anyway yeah so finally finally got a chance to meet Carl Jacobs seems like a super nice guy for someone so young he is surprisingly cultured when it comes to gaming my brother just just played Chrono Trigger in the last year and was like dude this is a masterpiece this is like one of the greatest games of all time and I&#39;m just like man and you know what this is this is crazy this is crazy his favorite final fantasy nine and I was like yeah Seven&#39;s overrated he&#39;s like I know dude dude all my controversial takes I now feel validated about so I&#39;m that&#39;s why I was pretty excited about that um yeah anyway yeah it was it was a great show had a really good time um and right I remember what I&#39;m supposed supposed to be talking about right now um oh wait hold on hold on okay last person last person that I actually got to hang out with a fair bit and oh this is great sorry sorry I promise I will stop doing story time in a little bit here uh Stephen he do you know Stephen he emotional damage guy ah yes yeah yeah yeah yes dude he is he&#39;s one of those YouTubers that is exactly the same in person and yet somehow so different like kind like more unhinged and like random if that makes sense like he&#39;s he&#39;s exactly the same guy but just like um I I I I&#39;m glad that he doesn&#39;t just upload absolutely everything he says because it&#39;s like whoa okay cool yep a good thing love Stephen I showed him the pictures of the Badminton Center and he&#39;s like dude back in China when I was like young I was like I played like semi-professionally so we start like yeah YouTuber badminton tournament yeah like dude could we make this a thing probably I&#39;m sure I mean lwig just did YouTuber Olympics if you can do like 15 different sports or whatever I&#39;m sure you can do one yeah exactly I&#39;m at least 115th as good as lwig right maybe yeah I&#39;m sure you can do it you have the cameras set up dude I I I&#39;d be so excited to do it uh Jawa juice says nerd sports but competent yeah so on that note we actually we talked about the channel badminton Insight a little while ago uh Greg and Jenny reached out hearing about it on the stream uh or hearing that we were talking about them on the stream and I nothing&#39;s for sure nothing&#39;s for sure but probably sometime let&#39;s say let&#39;s give ourselves some Breathing Room sometime in the next six to n months um going to come and and my intention I have pitched this Al I have asked the business team to try to sell a sponsorship for this they they said they think they can do it I would like to resurrect nerd Sports so Greg and Jenny they&#39;re Pro players uh but they also do YouTube as a side hustle and um I pitched them the idea so for their Channel they want to do a tour of the center and they pitched a concept that I think is brilliant I absolutely love it I&#39;m not going to spoil it because I want them to to tell you guys what it is but BAS basically it will involve me filming with them probably for like an entire day and it&#39;s going to be an absolute blast and that&#39;s going to go on their Channel and then I told them for our Channel I want to bring back nerd Sports I told them about the concept I linked them to the hockey one and I was like so here&#39;s the idea you&#39;re going to play against like regular Joe&#39;s on our team and we&#39;re going to come up with some with with some creative fun handicaps in order to try to level the playing field not only were they down but they started pitching back to me like really funny handicaps um Luke would you want to do you think could be prepped could your shoulder be rehabbed enough to be in this I&#39;ve I&#39;ve started a new routine that&#39;s been going really well I&#39;ll I&#39;ll make it work I would love to do that nerd Sports was so much fun I can&#39;t even like explain the return of the keyboard Warriors are we doing this yeah yeah yeah of course I&#39;ve always been down are we doing this dude I&#39;m so excited I&#39;m so excited so so just it&#39;s going to come on channel super fun um that doesn&#39;t mean Channel super fun is coming back that just means it&#39;s allow it&#39;s allowed to have one upload every like four years that just means that Greg and Jenny are coming out here they&#39;re flying an awful long way to be here um I want to make sure that everybody is maximizing the value of this trip and I didn&#39;t think that there was anything LTT that made a ton of sense with them Channel super fun nerd Sports on the other hand though we&#39;ve got professional players in our house why how could we not do this so dude I am uh I&#39;m super stoked I&#39;m I&#39;m super stoked we&#39;re gonna the thing is though okay so let&#39;s have a let&#39;s have a production meeting here because I don&#39;t think that I should play for the keyboard Warriors I don&#39;t think you can unfortunately what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on that am I do you think I&#39;m too good because let me tell you this hold on let me tell you this first to you I&#39;m probably some kind of bad Adon God yeah to I a bon ant I am a little thing that they squish under their thumb and then actually no they don&#39;t even bother they don&#39;t even bother to squish me under their thumb it&#39;s not even worth their effort in their if the Gap is that big then it&#39;s probably okay actually what I was going to say though if the Gap isn&#39;t that big I think you commentating it you know how we used to have commentators oh dude yeah okay well now now I want that role you commentating it I think would be amazing um if the Gap is that big though you could play but my my immediate reaction was that you would you would just commentate um okay what about this what about this for an idea what if I commentate the keyboard Warriors playing against Greg and Jenny and then at the end you try to step in we we take their we take their fully handicapped level um so whatever maybe they&#39;re wearing eye patches by this point and we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got 5B weights on their shoes like whatever it is that we&#39;ve done to them to make it so that the game is somewhat even right yeah uh we we put like uh oh man this would be great so you know how much of the badminton stroke is in the wrist right right so we put like um like wrist guards like rollerblading skateboarding like wrist guards on their hands so they can only swing their arms or something like whatever it is we end up having to do to make them barely able to compete against to to compete head to-head against normal yeah and then at the end I walk on and we see how many of them I can remove before they start to kick my butt Ah that&#39;s cool I like that so go all the way one way and then and then basically it&#39;s like a battle for me to try to get as many of them off as I can yeah I think that would be super cool do you have to do you have to have a uh like a buddy though would you because it&#39;s still Duos right m that&#39;s interesting so could I draft the best player from the keyboard Warriors maybe so I cuz I&#39;m commentating I&#39;m watching or or should I bring in like one of my buds like I&#39;ll bring in like my mix doubles partner or um or or what&#39;s his name that you just met at the event um emotional damage guy oh like Steven yeah okay that&#39;s an idea so goes from keyboard keyboard Warrior to like YouTuber people interesting okay okay I&#39;m going to keep that in mind might be a lot to align it might be a lot to align those trips lmg community in flpl chess says bring in jquan uh yeah yeah we could we could bring in the facility uh the facility manager for the for the badminton uh for the badminton courts okay all right I&#39;m going to think about it I&#39;m going to think about it I&#39;m going to see I&#39;m going to see see either way this going to be sick dude I&#39;m so excited I&#39;m so excited nerd Sports coming back uh you know what&#39;s funny is I mentioned this to I mentioned this well in front of Ivon I hadn&#39;t actually talked to her about it uh but I was talking to Stephen about the idea and yvon was there and she was like yeah nerd Sports was fun I think it&#39;d be fun to do nerd Sports again so you remember when we had like maybe 4% of ivonne&#39;s attention helping with the producer side of nerd sports like literally no offense to anyone else who was on team and anyone else who&#39;s on our team now and when I say team I don&#39;t mean the keyboard Warriors like our nerd sports team I mean our like lus Media Group team no offense to everyone else but for how little time and attention Ivon put into it I don&#39;t think anyone else could have gotten us the kinds of matchups that she did we some pretty cool teams that was that was crazy that was actually nuts if if if she was like full-time producer of nerd Sports I think not only could we bring it back but it could be awesome like 10 Milli views an episode awesome I&#39;d be a th% down nerd Sports was one of like the coolest things I I I used to share them with so many people too because they&#39;re like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just interesting cont it it plays into the whole concept of like I wish we could see like just average people compared to the Olympians at the Olympics it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that but you&#39;re really pitting them against each other and really showing the Gap like everything that you need to do to like tear someone down to the level of an average person because well you know that that was a big part of the original idea behind it right like it got kind of lost in the way that we we were a really small company and there were a lot of production challenges but like it so it kind of got lost in in everything I&#39;m not going to I&#39;m not going to lay the blame on anyone person&#39;s feet because it&#39;s a that&#39;s not cool and B it doesn&#39;t lie on any one person&#39;s feet um but what got kind of lost was that it was supposed to be about highlighting not professional top tier level athletes but the next down or the next down you know the people who were trying to go pro and basically really like putting in your face so that you cannot escape this how different these guys are from the person sitting on their couch going I could have caught that you know like actually standing on the court next to the Trinity Spartans do you remember that you&#39;re even a you&#39;re a reasonable freaking sized dude but did you not feel intimidated by those women yeah they dunked us pretty hard because I did there there was I mean we definitely fielded some some players on the on the keyboard Warriors that were not athletic but despite being keyboard Warriors we&#39;ve we&#39;ve always had a decent amount of people on the team that are fairly naturally athletic and we would just still get completely destroyed in every single sport I was like never close completely oh man yeah uh Stephen Chu Community manager says how I feel when I see a kicker miss an extra point in the NFL yeah exactly but like if you if you literally stood on that field and tried to make even the like even a below average kick you&#39;d go up there you&#39;d kick it and it&#39;d be like because you are not a world class athlete while there&#39;s like some dude running at you that can tackle you with the force of like an F-150 it&#39;s just like slightly nerve-wracking yeah exactly um and then you know obviously the the slight twist compared to Joe&#39;s versus Pros or regular people at the Olympics or other people have done this concept before and since is is the leveling of the playing field yeah the Nerfs illustrating just how ridiculous it has to get I mean by the time we were competitive with that hockey team dude they and I was I was telling the story at at at Creator Summit um they had their skates in little hula hoops so they couldn&#39;t and they had to keep the hula hoops on their skates so they couldn&#39;t lift them up they were holding pineapples in one hand they had to link arms with the player next to them so there were effectively only three of them on the ice compared to our six and they had to use little plastic toy sticks and it was still really close when we called Next Point wins with us with five skaters plus a plus a goalie that&#39;s not Tethered to someone fullsize sticks saying skaters is maybe a little much yeah that&#39;s a little generous five people that happen to be on Ice yeah I um I had scars from that for for years and now you can&#39;t normally see them but when I get really cold you can still see the lines from where the laces were oh no oh man that was rough uh yeah yeah blundetto says if I were out on the ice instead of Conor McDavid the Oilers would have won the Stanley Cup exactly but the thing is you&#39;re meing obviously right but so many people some people aren&#39;t yeah seem to actually think that when I was in my Prime I could have no you could no you couldn&#39;t have man no you couldn&#39;t have these guys are otherworldly talented um so anyway yeah nerd Sports I&#39;m super excited and I think there&#39;s a document I&#39;m supposed to be reading from to talk about stuff so right right right we hav made it through the first topic I&#39;m so sorry talking to YouTube in person one of the big things that they emphasized with these new AI features because as you can imagine in a room full of people whose job it is to create audio and backgrounds and video for a living right um there&#39;s going to be a pretty high degree of sensitivity around AI creation tools right so one of the things that they said kind of over and over and over again was hey this is not meant to be a replacement for human creativity these are meant to be tools to enhance human creativity and I feel like I feel like I both agree with YouTube and I also I wouldn&#39;t say disagree but have serious concerns about it so the way that they the way that they explained it was that there&#39;s like a a creative Loop right in your your ideation and your execution and your promotion and your publishing and your ideation your whatever right so you know theoretically you know if a perfect AI would just replace the human element of all of it it would ideate execute promote and publish and it would be just a perpetual motion machine that consumes fresh water and electricity right the way that they&#39;ve explained how AI tools will be rolled out on YouTube is that they will they will not be allowed to function like that because they will keep the human Creator in that creation loop at every stage there will have to be human input or human validation verification or human tuning but here&#39;s my issue this vo background thing I&#39;m certainly the human who&#39;s going to say stuff in front of it right because I I can see that being an obvious thing that people might do with this they&#39;re just like kind of creating a A vibe they&#39;re creating a mood for the background of just like like a short video talking about something or whatever right but what about all the humans who worked on like background creation other than me just like rubber stamping which one I think is good or fine-tuning the text prompt that I&#39;m giving it I feel like they they maybe were I feel like they were maybe addressing the concerns of the people in the room right because these are the people that are running the channels that are the the front men or front lady or whatever uh the people who own the business right like they&#39;re addressing business owners if you think about it top creators yes they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re people and and and and you know you connect with them and some of them some of them are business owners of like like a oneperson business and some of them are business owners of a of a of a a 50 or 100 person business right but they&#39;re but they&#39;re effectively business owners if they&#39;re operating at the kind of scale that they&#39;re at top Creator Summit right um what well what what about the people who work on their team and I feel like they didn&#39;t really say anything to me to address any of that so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my concern but then they also said the quiet part out loud right um and they were like well AI is here and so either we&#39;re going to like enable our creative Community with it or um they&#39;re going to use it anyway with third party tools and um or or our you know our top creators here won&#39;t be using it because you know Nar duells or using it for deep fakes or you know whatever kind of nonconsensual content or you know whatever right um so we&#39;re all we&#39;re really doing is accepting recognizing that this is the reality and arming our creative community and I was like yeah um fair enough right yeah I just don&#39;t I mean I I think this is my my problem where like the the vo stuff I just don&#39;t necessarily see it as like a a good thing um I I have a really hard time imagining who&#39;s going to use this to really benefit much of anything other than spammed out AI generated content which is already running all over uh shorts and Instagram so they they are correct that this isn&#39;t giving people a new tool this already existed you could already make AI generated backgrounds you could already make AI generated video backgrounds you could already make AI generated audio all this type of stuff it was all already possible they&#39;re just putting on YouTube but we&#39;ve seen the impact of these tools on other platforms and I personally haven&#39;t seen it generate anything of of real significant value um other than spam so I just I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t personally see the good benefit to it um but I I don&#39;t see it being dramatically worse than what we already have either if we make these tools less of like a like a nerdy um you know I spend my life working on tools for spamming people and more of a just I am a thing sitting in the YouTube Creator Studio that highly creative people now have access to easily and don&#39;t need to learn about is there an argument there that maybe that would actually increase the quality of some of the the AI use outputs I seriously doubt it personally cuz what&#39;s what&#39;s the value in it like what what is the what are you bringing to the table by AI generating a background to this video for six seconds honestly I think that&#39;s like that&#39;s a big part of it for me is like what am I doing with six seconds of background other than like but man part of it too though is like I in a lot of ways feel like a bit of an outsider at events like this because I can be pretty creative like I think if you tell me like hey lonus come up with an intro hook for the knock to a booth coverage at a trade show and you know I I I I get Jacob and I&#39;m like okay Jacob I need you to stab me in the back with my own screwdriver and we&#39;re going to film like my death scene in your booth and like like I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of creative but there&#39;s a level of creativity that um or like outside of the box thinking that I encounter every time I go to one of these meetups that I&#39;m just like yeah if you gave me a thousand years and a thousand monkeys and a thousand typewriters and a thousand caffeine pills I would never never come up with that like I I ended up they did an aign seating lunch just to force people to mingle a little bit and I ended up seated across from I really I&#39;m I feel terrible because I forget his name but I I ended up seated across from someone who is predominantly a shorts Creator and who actually only even made a channel to promote his ice cream filled dut shop and so his real business is like he he even has like apparel for it but his but his real business is actually like franchising out his ice cream filled doughnut like like restaurant and he just like apparently kills it hard enough on YouTube shorts that it not only is a great promotional tool for the business but it&#39;s making money but it&#39;s is but it&#39;s making money they&#39;re like killing it on YouTube completely by accident and I&#39;m and I&#39;m just sitting here going like sure you know right uh they they highlighted um they highlighted this um this super cool example of like tiny fandoms and like Community remixing uh where it was it&#39;s this channel I think it&#39;s called uh two two gay grandpas who had this travel Vlog where they just went and tried stuff and were super charming and they had like 90 subscribers or something like that and and they uploaded all these videos someone remixed it uploaded it somewhere else and was like hey we need to get these guys like some actual views because these videos are great and somebody needs to watch them and then they immediately like 100,000 subscribers uh like I wouldn&#39;t have I would never have thought to to put together something like that like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just and it&#39;s not like these are these are completely unique ideas they&#39;re just not things that I would have ever thought of and so when people when when YouTube releases a tool just because I have no idea what I would do with it doesn&#39;t mean that nobody&#39;s going to do anything really interesting with it and so I&#39;m always fearful saying I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what anyone would do with it I just don&#39;t know well I&#39;m trying to frame it that way specifically because I don&#39;t and like I hope that someone does I just the all of these tools already exist and we&#39;ve seen what the quick to arm themselves with tools especially when their free creative Community has done with them which by and large has been create spam content um or just like you know put a quote generator onto a thing put AI voice on top of all of the quotes put random backgrounds with like Roman or um Gothic or or old school Scandinavian or sorry Nordic I should say um or whatever like religious figures put the quotes in front of it play the AI voice spam it on the internet and then get tons of views like that that type of stuff is is rampant super rampant and that&#39;s where I&#39;m seeing all of the AI use in short form content go to I I haven&#39;t personally seen it to go to practically anything other than that so h i maybe I&#39;m not creative enough to find a use for 6sec AI generated Clips to go on short form content but maybe someone will I I imagine there&#39;s like uh someone&#39;s going to grab some form of instrument and sing weird random custom fun songs and have weird AI videos playing behind them CU it&#39;s like fun and artistic hopefully somebody does that I&#39;m sure there&#39;s like a thing or two that people can figure out um but I think by and large these tools are made to mass generate yeah to mass generate garbage and then try to play on people&#39;s um like mental things like wanting to hear quotes that agree with what they say and and stuff like that and then just Spam it out um which I don&#39;t is valuable okay YouTube will also be adding a carousel of highlighted comments and and AI comment reply suggestions to YouTube Studio which is supposed to mimic the style and tone of the Creator I asked some more um questions about this uh and basically my understanding is that the the the tuning of this should be done based on your own replies to people&#39;s comments on your channel I I asked about the possibility of um uploading data to help train it um that&#39;s not something that they&#39;re that they&#39;re looking at right now like I I there&#39;s remember when we when we showed that really cool uh Community project where um someone made like a like an AI searchable wow Q&amp;A like prompt yeah yeah so I kind of I asked like hey look if we had a transcription of like every question and answer we had ever done on the WAN show like is that something that we could we could provide to you to kind of help train this tool and they&#39;re like no not at this time um so this one like put like an unlisted video and make a bot that comments every single question on Wow ever into it and then have another bot that replies to each one of those from the Creator Channel with the proper response to build it ourselves we can do this we have the technology that&#39;s interesting you don&#39;t like it Google we&#39;ll do it ourselves here&#39;s my here&#39;s my problem with this a reply from the Creator is supposed to be a reply from the Creator and I don&#39;t that&#39;s immediately why I winced yeah this is this is this feels like a falsification of that interaction like when I reply to someone&#39;s comment in the comments um I I do go out of my way to sign it LS so you can tell it isn&#39;t another member of the team but that means I replied to you that doesn&#39;t mean that an AI replied to you and honestly and and I don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t mean any disrespect to any the channels that do this but when I go on a channel and literally every comment has a reply from the Creator that&#39;s like thank you for your comment YouTube already has a feature that suggests a quick reply it just is super rudimentary it just isn&#39;t very good it&#39;ll just say like thanks for your comment or um you thanks so much or something like that right um I feel like that&#39;s like cringe and and crappy um but this is worse because it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s like misleading manipulative look you want to get parasocial let&#39;s get parasocial you know fine you know let Le let&#39;s let&#39;s imagine that we&#39;re pen pals with our with our favorite Creator or whatever because they they replied thanks for your comment right but now we&#39;re we&#39;re almost creating like a like a whole other like like it&#39;s not even like real parasocial instead you&#39;re getting parasocial with an AI That&#39;s trained on what the Creator had said in the past like I dude I don&#39;t know it just seems pretty messed up right it it&#39;s it&#39;s like masked Creator AI because with with the Creator AIS that were made when you know gbd4 first popped off there was a bunch of like date this twitch streamer things right like I think there&#39;s an amaranth AI or something like that those ones are overt you know that you&#39;re interacting with a fake thing this one has the masking of it being actually you um so you you can&#39;t know and you have to know that certain creators that do certain things on the platform are going to use that to try to amp up to put some jet fuel on the fire of these parasocial relationships because they benefit from it in X Y or Z way um this is another there&#39;s so many this is God it&#39;s like the most frustrating thing with AI stuff is there&#39;s so much cool things that we could be doing with these tools but instead um we&#39;re creating fake parasocial relationships yeah we&#39;re doing just all the like worst most toxic possible things constantly it&#39;s so bad it&#39;s oh man it&#39;s almost it&#39;s almost like people are the problem Luke yeah people are the problem and you know like I mean these these tools are incredibly expensive like the the GPU cost compute cost the velopment cost of all these things yeah the power cost everything is insane for this infrastructure right now so they&#39;re trying to find ways that it can extract as much money as possible um on that note uh this isn&#39;t in our this isn&#39;t in our notes because it wasn&#39;t something that YouTube announced at made on YouTube um but one of the things they talked about a lot you know how I&#39;ve discussed with you that I felt like the days of the mega channel are kind of numbered at this point yeah and and I feel like YouTube is headed toward I show had uh 1 million live viewers on a live stream recently but okay so when I say okay I should explain what I mean by Mega Channel I guess what I mean is more like um more like a variety Channel um and I I mean it in when when I look at the the tech space uh I&#39;m referring to to us because we do a little bit of everything we do a review of a phone we do a tour of a factory that makes um that oh oh we do a tour of a facility that recovers gold from electronic manufacturing waste uh we do a video where we walk into someone&#39;s house and we cable manage it we do like we we do we have these kind of random formats that don&#39;t really have a Common Thread other than the personalities right and that they&#39;re for the most part about you know tech and and mostly IT Tech um a lot of other like really high growth highly engaged channels are much smaller 100,000 or 200,000 or 500,000 subscribers but they do one thing and they do it really well like uh one that I one that I really like is HDTV test um he&#39;s up to I think somewhere in the neighborhood of between 500,000 and and a million subscribers or something right now and he and he just he just talks about display technology like panel technology like really gets really gets deep into it and um one of the things that YouTube talked about a lot but in a way that I hadn&#39;t really thought about it before because I was thinking about it in terms of subject matter how people people are are searching out ways to go deep and and be and be part of a very very small in the no Community um they kind of came at it completely the other way and they kind of went like people are people are fans of just about anything and you know one of the examples they gave was uh there&#39;s this bridge uh 11 fo 8 in or something like that I forget what it is but there&#39;s like a famous overpass or bridge that sorry nothing oh that that has like tons of videos of you know just trucks like scraping the bottom or hitting it or or what whatever else and people will like take selfies with this famous bridge okay yeah yeah yeah chat chat knows what we&#39;re talking about the days of like Madonna you know being and okay that maybe that&#39;s a bad example because we have a current generation Madonna her name is Taylor Swift but but my my point is that the days of having like like one person you know Johnny Carson you know uh on on his late night show which I forget what it&#39;s called was it tonight show Late Show whatever whatever Johnny Carson&#39;s show was like way back in the in like the&#39; 60s um he was like like a single dominant force and if you like watched TV you like watched that uh these days like fandoms can be can be tiny uh like there&#39;s they showed this channel where this is a this is a YouTuber that has over 150,000 subscribers and literally her entire Channel fans of her Channel are watching her be a fan of Taylor Swift she uploaded a featurelength film worth a video reviewing one Taylor Swift album and and right so so you&#39;re not even like so so there&#39;s I think I just muted my mic am I good hello so there&#39;s like proxy fandoms now almost and so so so so I was thinking about it in terms of like subject matter and they&#39;re talking about it in terms of like and they didn&#39;t quite say this part but but the way that I interpret it as as wanting to be part of a community that isn&#39;t too big and almost like finding something whether it&#39;s like getting super deep into display panel Tech or whether it&#39;s getting super deep into like essentially the the online version of like a of like a boy or girl band uh fan group you know um that meets after school right um I forget where I was going with this I have no idea to be completely honest we&#39;re we&#39;re talking about AI stuff uh and you&#39;re talking about how how Niche creators are becoming more of a thing yeah yeah I don&#39;t know how that relates to AI stuff um are we talking about the new communities part no no yeah I forget that that&#39;s that&#39;s fine okay um you were you were about to admit lifelong Swifty oh no that dude I no I don&#39;t have to I don&#39;t have to I don&#39;t have to do I have to admit that like I I think I&#39;ve been pretty [Laughter] upfront how YouTube is pushing okay yeah yeah yeah not pushing toward smaller creators but I I think is is um is trending towards smaller creators and yeah I forget exactly what point I was trying to make but uh oh AI responses right right right right right right right right right so people crave smaller communities is what I was trying to say I think there on the internet and maybe it in society in general towards people being actually finally fatigued and overwhelmed by gigantic communities and I think that one of the ways that that is manifesting is as people is is people craving much much smaller communities and more Niche interests whether they were naturally interested in them or not part of the interest is being one of the people who&#39;s into that band that no one else knows and that that exists again in a huge or exists now in a huge way and so so they Illustrated that with fans of this bridge or fans of a super fan of Taylor Swift you like things that would have never occurred to you in or occurred to me in a thousand years like maybe maybe other people thought of that uh they they showed off this um this Grandma she&#39;s like in her 70s and she has a fan channel of like anime style video games she&#39;s like I didn&#39;t pick up gaming until about five years ago or a few years ago during covid or something like that I I forget exactly what they what the video that she said in the video they showed uh but I just like love this and and people just people just come and they and and they they join in this in this fandom and um now I really forget exactly where I was driving to with that but I I think that&#39;s a big part of what&#39;s driving this and right these AI responses I got there so I haven&#39;t slept much these AI responses it feels like they&#39;re designed to create like a fake kind of intimacy and smallness of community and almost designed to pray I see where you&#39;re going on that craving that people have for being part of something small and something personal something intimate yeah that sucks that makes a lot of sense that&#39;s where I was heading with this and look as much as you know as a business person you know I look at this fandom concept it&#39;s it&#39;s something that I think you guys regular viewers of the W show will know that I&#39;m not super into when we create a product I want you to buy it because it&#39;s a great product I don&#39;t even mind if you buy it if you love the work we do and you want to support our Channel but what I don&#39;t want you to do is to buy it because you&#39;re a fan I don&#39;t want you to just mindlessly throw your money at us because you&#39;re a fan with no capacity for rational thought that&#39;s not that&#39;s not what I what I ask of you it&#39;s not what I want of you and I feel like I feel like an Outsider with that perspective I feel like there&#39;s I feel like there&#39;s a lot of people that um want to lean into fostering that kind of Paras sociality I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a word um but that kind of uh fan like behavior and um and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy and I don&#39;t think that it is I especially don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy when it it&#39;s fake like if I actually show up at LTX and I actually like chat with you and take a selfie and you have actually have a really great personal interaction with me or something and you&#39;re like yeah I met lonus and he seems like a nice guy at least to the extent that I was able to gauge that from chatting with him for 31 and a half seconds at a trade show right that that clarification kind of matters but yeah I I do generally agree with where you&#39;re going that&#39;s fine that&#39;s at least sort of that at least has somewhat of the like basis in reality right in your real exp lived experiences whereas if you tell me lonus seems like a cool guy because he trained a he used he created a data set and trained an AI on how to reply to my comment what yeah yeah not great I I don&#39;t like it at all um I&#39;ve said your name before maybe maybe they can make this a lot better uh by flagging what things are AI responses communicating to the user that it was an AI respon brought that up um in my opinion that would help a lot because because honestly if these are just like standard questions you get all the time and you&#39;re just like yeah whatever it typed out like a 20w thing at that point they&#39;re basically just like fancy canned responses um but even a canned responses feature I think would be useful for some people uh but yeah if they&#39;re at least communicating I don&#39;t feel like they intend to because I think they want this to do the things that we&#39;ve been talking about but if they did if they flagged it if they made it so that it was in your face and obvious for the user that this was you know lonus Ai and not lonus um then that would be good but you know what would be crazy I bet you this thing would start signing things off with- LS it&#39;s trained off his comments right he&#39;s he&#39;s probably the main commenter on the channel every single one has no no because other ones are are written by other people lus isn&#39;t the only person that has commented but I I still think it would probably do it sometimes because enough of those comments are signed by Ls I&#39;m assuming like at least 30 40% over 90% over 90% okay okay yeah so then it&#39;s definitely going to sign with DH LS which if it isn&#39;t flagged as an i AI is immediately egregiously misleading um all right shall we keep talking yeah let&#39;s see if it gets better from here so far neither or none of these features have really um made me concerned about the future of content on the platform this next one does um they&#39;re adding an inspiration tab with AI brainstorming and idea generation tools with the intention again this is the way they kind of communicated to us with the intention being that it&#39;s it&#39;s a helper you know it&#39;s an assistant um you know you&#39;re still expected to to kind of feed it I I asked like you know what are you guys looking at in terms of like data set like is this trained on uh my best videos is it trained on my videos is it trained on videos um from similar creators that share a of over audience overlap with me is it based on the overall um what what&#39;s the word Corpus of content on YouTube like what what what&#39;s the data set for this and they they didn&#39;t really get too specific about it but um unfortunately I I did I did try to ask some tough questions I don&#39;t know why they keep inviting me to these things honestly I uh tend to be a bit of a thorn um I&#39;m a nice Thorn I&#39;m a nice Thorn though nice Thorn um pretty thorn uh demure so the idea is that it&#39;s it&#39;s a Helper but the the problem with any AI is the second you start training it on something that was AI generated it starts to it starts to Decay it starts to become a photocopy of a photocopy and and the actual creativity starts to disappear and I guess what my concern is is that on the surface I look at this and I go yeah that could be kind of helpful I have a couple of ideas I spitball them into the inspiration tab it craps out a couple of other you know ideas that are rift off of yeah maybe some videos that were really successful okay I go and make that do we start doing that enough that the videos that are being uploaded to the platform while not entirely AI generated are at least influenced Enough by AI that we start training our AI on AI inspired ideas and start just like start losing some of that humanness and some of that creativity across the platform to your point earlier I totally get that these are not new tools I could totally just do this in chat GPT right now yeah but but this is specifically trained off of YouTube exactly in what capacity not sure but it&#39;s trained off of YouTube and if it continues to be trained off of YouTube are are we going to be like the snake eating its own tail a little bit here and just consume ourselves consume everything that&#39;s that&#39;s good about it that&#39;s unique about it yeah that kind of says it all doesn&#39;t it I I feel like basically everything I said about the vo 6sec Clips just yeah again it applies to here um I&#39;m not surprised that they&#39;re doing it this also feels to me like it&#39;s trying to compete with Mr Beast new tool um Mr Beast H what would you even call it how would I find this Mr Beast YouTube and I forget surprisingly surprisingly we actually don&#39;t really subscribe to a ton of like Creator tools yeah view stats Pro um is a is a Mr Beast tool um I think this is the one is this the right one I&#39;m pretty sure I whatever some Mr Beast tool I&#39;m not 100% sure but I think this is it um is it it does things like what you&#39;re talking about it tries to show like if you&#39;re like oh thumb thumbnail with a golden controller um I I I believe it can do things like try to find that for you I I haven&#39;t used this in a while I looked at it at one point in time so I hope I&#39;m not saying stuff that&#39;s wrong um get to no Pro yeah organize and brainstorm your next upload uh make better decisions with different with more data blah blah blah blah blah I think they&#39;re trying to bring these tools onto YouTube natively uh track long and short outlier videos in each category that one&#39;s actually pretty interesting um search thumbnails by URL and image so you can if I remember correctly with that tool you can search for like thumbnails basically by giving topics and then it&#39;ll try to find you thumbnails for inspiration so you can like fall in line with a type of theme that&#39;s happening on the platform which again just contributes to more seism um which I don&#39;t know again the tools already exist they&#39;re just trying to bring more eyeballs directly onto YouTube and have them leave less I think in non-ai features YouTube has also added communities which are similar to Creator control Discord servers or subreddits where both the Creator and their subscribers can post text links and images this one believe it or not I actually like um there&#39;s a lot of friction moving people off platform to be clear I don&#39;t see this as a substitute for off-platform engagement I think that off-platform engagement is important but you know how we have both float plane uh where we have like 37,000 paying subscribers right now so we&#39;ve got our float plane platform but we also turned on YouTube memberships which has like I think another 500 or something like that members there&#39;s certain people did we hit 38 we&#39;re not quite but we&#39;re 37,9 31 I know that&#39;s why I said 37,000 I didn&#39;t want to I didn&#39;t want to I didn&#39;t want to exaggerate you can Round Up by by 69 I think 69 is an acceptable round number to round up on I&#39;ll tell you what Luke I&#39;ll tell you what why don&#39;t you screen share some of the great exclusives we have on float plan right now go ahead do it real quick let&#39;s try to add the 69 wow let&#39;s get it let&#39;s get it done and then I can say we have 38,000 subscribers on play okay wow so you you go ahead get get get some get some uh get some cool exclusives people might want to check out up there and in the meantime I I will keep talking um so we have about 500 members on YouTube as well I&#39;m not going to say no to people who are willing they they pay they pay extra the last time I looked at it they pay extra we&#39;re transparent about that because YouTube takes a very significant cut there that does not go toward the salaries of our developers who develop flow plane um but they just don&#39;t want to leave the platform and a lot of people are like that they they just are not interested in engaging off of the YouTube platform and I think that there should be features that allow us to be there for them um and engage with them like I I like Community posts um there&#39;s actually a Fair bit of pretty solid engagement there um solid interaction I just wish that it was uh I wish that community members could interact with each other more easily they&#39;ve they&#39;ve significantly tamped down on the number of like sexbot comments and stuff like that it&#39;s not perfect there there&#39;s still oh it still happens but dude you compare it to what it was like a year ago arms race yeah it it&#39;ll always happen to a certain degree I think um they&#39;ve improved a lot can do give credit where it&#39;s due and I think you and I have talked a lot over the years about how underinvested YouTube comments and Community is so is this exactly the right way for them to do it I don&#39;t know maybe maybe not but is it something I think my biggest problem with this is a complete non-confidence that I have with Google these days um to the point where there&#39;s like serious conversations about ripping out um workplace solutions that we have at at the company from Google right now because there&#39;s a big question on like what of this is even going to exist in a year uh because they keep rug pulling every single thing that they have uh and then extremely core features that other platforms and other companies are providing these days YouTube is or sorry Google is not providing so they&#39;re not expanding in the way that other companies are and they&#39;re just killing products that people actually do really like constantly so if they&#39;re going to create this communities feature and creators are going to invest into because it is an investment if creators are going to invest into making these communities vibrant and trying to encourage people to come over here very likely cannibalizing their own already created Discord communities um that have been uh you know cultivated and grown over the years have moderators built into it have likely tools made for moderation all this other type of stuff that they&#39;ve custom built for that or custom tuned for that and then YouTube rug PS this new community feature it will be incredibly frustrating for genuinely everyone involved and at this point in time I have no trust in Google that they will actually keep this around because they&#39;ve proven that that would be misplaced trust um so there it would be unwise for me to do so I think it&#39;s also as much as I do like things like Community posts um this feels like it&#39;s creating yet another thing that has to have moderation from it um from your team or from your community this creates a we have this we have this problem where so many YouTubers are doing weird creepy things with kids and now this is another thing that parents are going to have to be aware of in regards to ways that there could be bad communication um because I think it I mean it took years for parents to be properly aware of Discord um which like even it&#39;s barely seem to be now barely okay yeah I don&#39;t know in our parent teacher conferences this year the teachers brought up Discord for the first time okay yeah so give some idea of how long it takes for things to make it to the mainstream something like this is going to take forever um so there&#39;s like H I want to like it if this was honestly like eight years ago I think I would have been super stoked um but now especially in light with everything else that&#39;s coming out I&#39;m just a little sketched out let me play Devil&#39;s Advocate um it&#39;s G to be hard but I&#39;m going to try um I believe in you Google you&#39;re right kills a lot of stuff they kill a lot of good stuff they kill a lot of beloved stuff um they create a bunch of kind of half-baked stuff and then they kill that and that&#39;s probably for the best the YouTube team do they really create and kill that much compared to compared to Google could we could we have a bit more trust in the YouTube Team specifically and I I&#39;m just I&#39;m just asking questions uh do you want to jump on that or you so they they did actually they killed paid channels um they did bring I think I think it&#39;s called is memberships now YouTube memberships they they brought that back but it wasn&#39;t right away so they got creators into the paid Channel cycle and then dropped all of them while they were developing the new ones they they didn&#39;t develop the new one and then convert everybody over they just dropped everyone for at least a couple years I think it was to the point where again so this is this is actually a community building thing right they had creators build communities on these paid private channels um or whatever exactly it was called or however it worked it&#39;s we we didn&#39;t use it and it&#39;s been a long time um but they they had us included right like we might have actually used that at that time if it existed and was good um but it it didn&#39;t um so they they got creators like uh awesome sauce bitwit Kyle um creators like that bought into this ecosystem brought their users in got people to subscribe built these communities were were talking more active all that type of stuff in that Community trying to incentivize uh people to actually enjoy their time there right um and then all of those creators just got completely dropped and now they have to bring all of their audience again to some other type of platform all of their all of their committing a Pat patreon or or whatever else um and then they incre they start YouTube membership and now it&#39;s like oh my God so do I bring everyone back or do I split and do both or what so like the they have done that before I will say however that I do generally agree that the YouTube Team doesn&#39;t seem as rug pulley as Google as a whole uh most of the things that YouTube has introduced there&#39;s there&#39;s some some semblance of it still around I think you know what came up in one of my breakouts at the summit it&#39;s one of my favorite features that they killed I never got into uh stories on like Snapchat or any other platform because I don&#39;t use those platforms I actually really liked them on YouTube and they never really fully implemented the feature it literally never worked on my folding phone um even though that&#39;s Android you know and like kind of a Google product and stuff and then they just like quietly got rid of it when they introduced shorts and I uh and it came up in one of the that people loved stories and were like hey can you guys bring it back and YouTube&#39;s YouTube&#39;s argument for why they got rid of it and didn&#39;t bring it back we conveniently had the person who spearheaded stories right there in our breakout these these Summits are really amazing because we really do get access to top level people at YouTube and get to have these conversations um the reason was apparently even though creators really liked it user engagement with it was super low and so I don&#39;t know maybe you guys you guys can tell me um you know did you do you miss stories at all like or do you just not care and and I maybe just um kind of out of touch and like feeling like you guys were engaging with it um I we didn&#39;t really post that many because my daily driver phone didn&#39;t support it but uh yeah never used them nope didn&#39;t care at all yeah so didn&#39;t care didn&#39;t use so there you go I don&#39;t remember it we got like one person who missed them and cared that&#39;s about it they&#39;re apparently kind of hard to use I mean it was a half-baked implementation so that&#39;s probably part of the problem yeah but other than people have brought up dislikes I I don&#39;t really see that as taking away a feature so much as as changing the functionality of the site so I&#39;m not sure I fully agree with that one they definitely did get rid of annotations I think feature uh the ability to view dislikes on a video yeah I think so well I think I think that you could say the ability to gauge sentiment on a video they&#39;ve made it worse but they didn&#39;t take it away you can see they took away your ability to to yeah that doesn&#39;t mean anything when there&#39;s no dislikes Luke I&#39;m not a fan of the change I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the removal of a feature so much as it is the changing of the functionality of a feature to make it worse which is not a good thing I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite the same thing that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying they removed stories if it ex if if it was an overall Karma counter I think I would agree with you but because you could separately see like and dislike I think dislike is its own feature at that point like and dislike are separate features if it was a combined total and they took away your ability to see the combined total or something that&#39;s that&#39;s modifying it but uh yeah I don&#39;t know I I think if it&#39;s dislike and with its own counter they removing a feature which is dislike um agree to disagree all right fair enough there you go um YouTube is also testing a new hype feature which they actually didn&#39;t talk about really at the um at the summit where viewers can choose to promote a recent video posted within the last 7 days from a creator with fewer than 500,000 subscribers highly promoted videos will appear in a special leaderboard and will be marked as fan favorites viewers can hype up to three videos a week for free or pay for more pay for man so this is back to I guess actually I I actually wasn&#39;t aware of this one I didn&#39;t carefully go through the made on you um thing after we were like in person showing a lot of it so I I didn&#39;t know about this one uh this just feels like monetizing superate communities again yeah and and small creators cuz cuz what you&#39;re if if you really want to make it you&#39;re not going to pay for your own channel to get hyped oh about it that way yeah no immediately that&#39;s that&#39;s what this is for sure there are also you&#39;re also going to have super fans that that do that for sure I think they&#39;re mostly going to use their free ones and then you&#39;re GNA have some hyper super fans that will actually use the paid version and then I guarantee you small creators that are really hellbent on making it as a Creator whether this feature really works or not are going to invest money into hyping their own content um with their own actual account or if it shows whose account did it they&#39;ll just make fake ones and do it that way ready for a little bit more uh Devil&#39;s Advocate sure wonky donkey in float plane chat asks is this feature because there are so many massive incumbents that no one can rise up is this potentially a clumsy um flawed tool that could benefit somebody I think if that was true YouTube could just do it organically which I think YouTube does extremely successfully um I think YouTube is one of if not the best platforms on the internet for organic growth of a Creator um I think something like twitch you know is going to naturally based on how twitch Works be a lot worse at that uh but I see I see new creators on YouTube uh you know if I if I was on it every day I&#39;d probably see new creators on YouTube every day I think that&#39;s fair I was I was Devil&#39;s advocating I was Devil&#39;s advocating advocating advocating extremely strong discoverability mechanics already like it&#39;s it&#39;s honestly really really good almost to the point where it if anything it&#39;s like pulling down its most successful creators because it&#39;s kind of so obsessed with showing you new stuff all the time um all right let&#39;s get through the rest of the YouTube stuff and talk about some more let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s move on but there&#39;s a couple more things um YouTube has confirmed they are rolling out pause screen ads more widely so I&#39;m sure I know how you guys feel about that um who cares yeah cool YouTube is also expanding its creator takeover program where advertisers can pay a premium to take over all the ads on a particular channel for some period of time uh just so you guys know we were sent an email from YouTube inviting us to join this program and we have confirmed with them that we do have the ability to opt out of takeovers that are from advertisers that we have a strong objection to cool so we actually recently um reconfirmed uh because they brought it up with us again um that we have continued to be opted out of any gambling and alcohol related ads so you guys will not see those on our Channel if everything is running correctly and we will apply our typical um our typical sponsor um restrictions guidelines our typical sponsor guidelines uh to these takeovers as well the only exception you might see is if we miss an email or something like that like it it will it if something bad happens it will be it will be an accident um that&#39;s not me priming you guys for that we&#39;re going to accident on purpose I&#39;m just saying we are not perfect as you guys well know we are very human and accidents do happen um so that would be that would be why that would happen uh we actually have we have published our our sponsor like our our sponsor guidelines uh Luke do you have any idea where that is it&#39;s on the Forum somewhere isn&#39;t it uh it is it is on the Forum somewhere but I just don&#39;t know where yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see it right now and I yeah sorry if someone if someone has the link post it in the float plane chat uh but it&#39;s somewhere on the Forum where we outline all of the things that uh we are we are not okay with at this present time all right oh wait I might have found it lmg spons do not work with list discussions yeah there we go there it is uh we don&#39;t do drugs and alcohol we do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time we I love that at this time you know we leave the door open but not at this time uh crypto nfts icos um this is not a field we want to get mixed up in at this time uh credit loans um we want to avoid promoting these things directly we&#39;ve worked with banks and Financial in stions in the past that offer these services but we want to avoid promoting them directly uh Drop Shipping as a service um after our initial fact finding we worked with one of these companies last year but based on community feedback we do not plan to again gaming chairs that do not prioritize ergonomics um mental health therapy we are pro therapy we advise anyone reading this to prioritize their mental health uh but we do not intend to promote any companies who profit from these services at this time online sports betting um gambl more broadly we do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time pay to win games so our bar for games is that we do actually have someone internally play the game if it can be enjoyed without the need to syn money into it we know this is a fine line but we&#39;re okay with it um if it is absolutely not enjoyable without uh paying money then we do not um feel it is appropriate to promote at this time and finally unproven Kickstarter indogo campaign we will work with companies that have a long history of launching products um and that basically just use these platforms as a marketing vehicle but just complete nobody&#39;s we just don&#39;t want people to get burned and we&#39;ve accidentally promoted things that we were uh really unhappy that we ultimately put mostly back in like kickstarters Heyday yeah yeah y so that&#39;s our that&#39;s our guidelines and speaking of sponsors why don&#39;t we tell you about our sponsors for the show today I&#39;m sorry I know we only did one topic but it was a boy was it ever a meaty one I didn&#39;t realize how long

okay okay I&#39;m going to explain the joke I&#39;m going to explain the joke okay so in the movie Anchor Man which is like one of those kind of funny movies from the early to mid 2000s um the character is sort of a a blowhard anchor man played by Will frell who was much younger then um sorry this is horrible uh basically he just reads anything on the prompter so at some point to mess with him for some reason or another somebody puts go f yourself San Diego on the prompter and he just reads it so it&#39;s a quote it&#39;s a reference okay just anyway oh my God Sammy our social like

the ug green Uno series by using the link in the video description that that actually sounds super cute I can&#39;t I can&#39;t see it but I imagine it is super cute it is as cute Asing back to oh you can see it there never mind cute all right uh I guess we should probably do another topic like I don&#39;t even know if we&#39;re going to get to merch messages but like we have a really good deal have to many so yeah go for it okay well we&#39;ve got a really good deal to announce um it is 50% off our remaining water bottle and spout lid inventory so uh the link here is to the 40 oz bottle but I think this applies to every bottle on the site while supplies last water bottles featuring the old spout lid as well as individual purchases of the old spout lid which many of you have noticed is compatible with many other water bottles are 50% off due to the discount these productss are considered final sale they are not eligible for return but this is a really good deal you guys are going to want to check it out the reason we&#39;re clearing them out is we finally have inventory of our new in-house design spout lid and Luke is not a huge fan I&#39;m going to talk you through why I think it&#39;s great and then Luke can talk you through what he thinks about it and you can decide for yourself if you want to stock up on old water bottles and spout Lids at the discount or if you want to wait for the new one so uh luk do you have the lid there yes it features easier cleaning so there&#39;s two O-rings there&#39;s the one between the lid and the water bottle and then there&#39;s the one between the spout top and the lid both of those have pull tabs on them now which make them much easier to take out for cleaning the threading for the spout top is on the outside now rather than the inside we know that some people are not going to like the feel of the spout top thread against their lips we went back and forth on this over and over and over and over again and what it kept coming down to is that our major concerns with the old SP top lid were two one was that the clip would break pretty easily um too easily for us not that easily like to be clear if you buy one it&#39;s probably going to last okay as long as you don&#39;t drop it but they did break too easily and the new one is much much harder to break and then the other concern we had is that it&#39;s not the easiest to clean and when it came down to what our design goals were for this product easy cleaning was a major one and we decided to keep the threads on the outside so that it&#39;s much much easier to clean the hinge has been reinforced to prevent it oh wait I already said that it is not yet released but it will be included on the new restock of water bottles um Luke has some concerns yeah I think the the inre the increased um you know cleanliness features are genuinely super cool and probably make the whole thing worth it regardless um concerns Luke there are some downsides that come with it like one thing that I noticed is very commonly with the old lid you could do this um if you notice I didn&#39;t really do much to it and it immediately went down to this I&#39;m trying to show but there&#39;s it&#39;s black on a dark background um it went on this downward angle with the new lid if you if you whip it open even with a bunch of force it just stays there which makes it so that with that much force it actually held position but when you go to drink it it hits you in the face um so you actually have to like kind of click it down um that results in some wear that I suspect the support team will get messages about on the little nubbins that hold it in place but I&#39;ve been informed that those are designed to do that uh so they&#39;re fine I just I think the support team is going to get some messages cuz they wear quite quickly um or they first bit of wear yeah the first bit of wear looks like a lot and then and then it doesn&#39;t do much more I&#39;m assuming and then it doesn&#39;t do much more yeah that that is something that I&#39;m actually not very concerned about yeah sure and worst case scenario hey we got you bro so yeah exactly and then the the last one is the the threads on the outside again genuinely a really big bump for cleanliness and makes it worth it but on the old one it&#39;s incredibly easy to close I I use our water bottles literally every single day extensively I drink at least 64 ounces of water out of our water bottles every single day usually more than that so I&#39;m using Enthusiast constantly Luke has made Gins of pee with our water bottle oh yeah all of them um so I have I have feelings about this okay that&#39;s all um the old ones opening and closing you you you can just do that 100% accurate every single time you I I know now that this is closed um with the new ones that is not the case because the threads on the outside are less reliable um so like did that work no um and I can tell because the whole lid kind of rocks back and forth but if you just like grab it and turn it it will work like it&#39;s fine it&#39;s not that it doesn&#39;t close it&#39;s just that like this old maneuver that I used to do to like flick it off and flick it back on instantly every single time no longer works with 100% reliability so if you&#39;re coming from the old lid just don&#39;t trust a a random spin because yeah again it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t actually happen but if you just twist it closed um it does go and will hold so I don&#39;t know just something to be aware of there&#39;s a few questions Matt man asks um would you sell the O-rings with the tabs separately I would buy them but I don&#39;t like the outside threads uh they are not compatible with the old Lids unfortunately again to improve the sanitation sanitar uh to improve the ease of cleaning uh we did redesign the lid even though it cosmetically looks an awful lot like the old one similar yeah it&#39;s not the same y um the new what do you mean I&#39;m not happy with Luke&#39;s complaints Luke brought these up before the show and I was like you should talk about them like where we believe in transparency I don&#39;t know how many times I have to prove that do you need me to cut open a lid is it I&#39;ll go to 105 L lid L I&#39;ll go to 105 oh we got a band saw I&#39;ll do it I haven&#39;t broken something in a while I like I said I use these every day I know I know some people say that uh they&#39;ve broken a bunch of the hinge arm things I&#39;ve never broken one of them I don&#39;t necessarily know what&#39;s causing that to happen I throw them around all the time oh maybe I just don&#39;t drop them that makes sense and not all of them are weak it&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a plastic flow issue it&#39;s not obvious looking at it why it would be weak but sometimes the way the plastic it&#39;s so ours isn&#39;t actually that much like bigger but the way the plastic flows and cools um it will be it will be much stronger it looks a yeah you can you can tell it&#39;s bigger but it&#39;s not it&#39;s more to a water bottle there&#39;s so much more to a water bottle lid than I think most people would probably think about this one was very thoughtful I promise you that yeah um I I would I would The more I&#39;ve thought about it I should probably get these even though I I don&#39;t love the threads on the outside um just because it&#39;s going to be cleaner I clean mine all the time but still this is very simple to clean which makes me believe that it&#39;s going to become more clean uh because some topics Luke oh okay yeah sorry all right as much as I&#39;d love to keep talking about our merch we got to do some topics uh Linux Gamers can no longer play GTA 5 Rockstar has updated GTA 5 with battle eyee anti-che breaking Linux compatibility and rendering steam deck players unable to play the games online multiplayer notably GT 5 was one of the top 10 most popular games played on the platform last week and has been in the top 20 for the past two years it is not entirely clear why Rockstar did this the company has blamed valve for the issue and directed all questions to them however according to a 2021 comment from valve battle eye is fully compatible with their proton compatibility layer and developers simply have to email battleye to enable it in fact there are already many games using battle eye that are supported by proton nice as a potential Silver Lining to the recent Cloud strike sorry Crow strike you mean is this a is this a typo uh Cloud strike yeah it&#39;s a typo okay I was like what&#39;s Cloud strike um Microsoft appears to be preparing to push security software outside of the windows kernel which would likely possibly include anti-che yeah May in turn allow for more games to work on Linux yeah oh is that the good news that you were referring to before yes yeah that&#39;s pretty cool that&#39;s actually enormous like I don&#39;t know I I know a very significant amount of people that only don&#39;t want to switch to Linux at this point because of multiplayer games that they wouldn&#39;t be able to play because of anti-che um this is so cool this is this is actually massive it&#39;s it&#39;s in my opinion maybe cuz I don&#39;t play GTA that&#39;s probably accurate uh a bigger story than the GTA 5 thing if it actually happens if they pull anti-che out of the kernel and then we&#39;re able to get more of the games that were previously kind of locked to Windows onto Linux that will be enormous um yeah regarding um your game that doesn&#39;t work anymore in at least one case it seems a player was able to get a refund for GTA 5 on Steam but another person on Reddit apparently had the request rejected uh a message from Steam support seems to suggest that valve is working with Rockstar to fix the issue uh we do need to get through a few more topics here just because I have a play to go to hey hey V what are we seeing again we&#39;re seeing the Great Gatsby I&#39;m very excited um Nintendo has finally sued calor but in a kind of surprising way um Nintendo and the Pokemon company of which Nintendo is part owner announced they have filed a lawsuit in Tokyo district court against pocket pair the developer of the Indie Smash Hit pal World while Pokemon fans have expected this to happen for some time like basically from the moment that game came out the nature of the lawsuit is not at all what anyone expected when pal world came out Twitter threads like the one Luke is about to show you guys purported to show Pals from pal World whose designs plagiarized the designs of Pok\u00e9mon essentially accusing pocket parir of copyright infringement so many people made complaints uh to the Pokemon so many people made complaints to the Pokemon company that they released a statement saying they didn&#39;t Grant permission of Pokemon IP or assets but Nintendo isn&#39;t suing over copyri right so like Art and Design at least not yet they are suing over the infringement of multiple patents meaning that they&#39;re arguing that palor a survival crafting third person shooter with indentured servitude as a core feature is functionally similar to Pokemon okay the patents that Nintendo fields are being infringed have not been revealed but one good guess is a patent found by PC Gamer it broadly covers a game system that allows switching between two modes where the first mode is aiming and throwing an item that imparts an effect on a character in an Overworld and the second mode is aiming and throwing a fighting character in an Overworld to perform an action such as fighting another character to be clear this patent does not cover a game program that allows a player character to catch a character only during a fight what okay okay hold on hold on an example of what Falls within this patent is contained in Pokemon Legends archus the first mode would be how players can throw items at Wild po outside of combat the second mode would be how you can throw a Pokeball containing a tamed Pokemon at a wild Pokemon to initiate a fight or at something like a tree to collect berries you can patent that a lot of gaming patents are really stupid the directional Arrow from Like Crazy tacki Taxi who they sue Simpsons Hit and Run the pointy directional Arrow uh mini games and loading screens that&#39;s what there&#39;s like hundreds of these EX really stupid oh yeah crazy dude yeah that&#39;s trash and I don&#39;t like it yep are you here good news the good news here okay is pocket pair made enough bucket loads of money and must have known that this was coming that they will maybe be able to defend themselves maybe we&#39;ll see uh Japanese Court not American court for people that are trying to be loal right now oo Japanese Court that&#39;s going to be rough yeah um not that I&#39;m saying it will be biased I&#39;m just saying this is clearly Nintendo&#39;s home turf where they are going to have more experience also a bunch of people are pointing out that apparently the Microsoft moving antivirus out of the kernel thing won&#39;t stop uh anti-che maybe something maybe I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t read super deeply into it was just hoping that would be the case and I know some other people were echoing that as well um so we&#39;ll see what happens um I wonder if the excitement from everyone of that happening might incentivize anti-che companies to look at Linux a little bit more even even that I don&#39;t know just pocket pair is also hold on sorry pocket pair also Japanese but what I suspect is they have far less experience navigating the court system there Nintendo does yeah when I say home turf sorry my intention was not to say Japan my intention was to say specifically Japanese Court yeah yeah yeah oh boy well good luck pocket pair um how much time do you have uh Hey Von how long&#39;s the walk how long&#39;s the walk I&#39;m finding out uh oh quick clarification from our degoogle your life part two video uh we discussed next cloud and we said next cloud is more home user whereas own cloud is more Enterprise uh we had a chat with nexcloud about this and they said hey that&#39;s kind of outdated information and they actually according to them have significantly larger customers than owncloud with some installations in the many millions um so I just wanted to clarify that cool uh okay I need to go fairly soon should we smash some merch messages before you go and then save these topics for next week because we haven&#39;t done any merch messages uh sure let me just see if there&#39;s anything extremely important yeah Asus refused to repair a service center damaged laptop by Reddit user Matrix who works as aior effects technical director recently alleged that an authorized as service center that he asked to repair his $12,000 Pro art laptop instead seriously damaged the device damages included a screen that was cracked from corner to corner as well as having at least one corner shattered this kind of sounds like shipping damage but hold on let&#39;s keep going the internal frame was allegedly deformed and the display surface peeled off at the edges according to animatrix the service center initially denied responsibility then confirmed that the staff had damaged the laptop after anim Matrix called their head office animatrix claims that Asus refused to replace the laptop with an equivalent because it is out of warranty despite the fact that this would be a matter of liability not warranty it nonetheless took over two months to get Asus to repair most of the damage animatrix further says that the original problem with the laptop which the authorized service center incorrectly said would require the motherboard to be replaced was later fixed by a smaller service center without replacing the motherboard the laptop was originally provided by Asus to animatrix in exchange for promoting their proart line using their work in feature film visual effects that last bit complicates this a lot when we h h why does that change things well I don&#39;t think that changes things at all to be honest this was an outof warranty repair that he did at an authorized service center that they broke his computer at so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it really has anything to do with how he got it included internet frame they confirmed if I took my car which is hold on it was it did they know it was out of warranty I&#39;m just checking yeah no this is out of Warrant okay no you&#39;re right you&#39;re right then it nothing do with how we got it yeah yeah okay cuz if it was a sample and this was a warranty conversation then that gets a little bit hairier because there can be an understanding that like yeah well you know here it is but like whatever it is what it is if this is if this is a service center and an outof warranty situation if they damaged it man they they&#39;ve just got to figure out what their escalation workflow needs to be because i&#39; I&#39;ve talked about this at the very highest level the willingness to make these things right is there they just have such a a broken broken process that like now I&#39;m the one who has to raise this the media is the one who has to talk about this instead of just getting the customer message through to the people who can make this decision and make it right yeah cuz like if you read the Reddit threat honestly this this Skips a lot of steps um if you read the Reddit thread if I remember correctly at one point in time they tried to offer him like uh some like this is $112,000 laptop right this is a professional laptop probably with like a Quadro card in it stuff like that like there&#39;s this is not a normal laptop um if if I remember correctly they tried to offer him some like 8 gig whatever random standard Normie laptop um in response to it which he was fairly obviously like no which is why it took so long to actually get solved this is really frustrating they they just need to get it together they need to have like a global escalation line they need to staff it with people who are empowered to make these decisions and they just need to deal with this like I&#39;m so I&#39;m so tired of seeing this they&#39;ve got to be tired of seeing this you know yeah um the last thing we said we would talk about is the ryzen 9000 launch um according to uh mind Factory a large German e retailer specializing in electronics um they have publicly available sales numbers that show they&#39;ve only sold a couple hundred units of 9,000 Series chips since their La since their launch however this doesn&#39;t reflect how well AMD is doing in the pre-built Market which seems to be significantly larger that&#39;s uh wow that&#39;s a bummer I guess it turns out that super um I guess it turns out that when you&#39;ve got x3d anything other than x3d is going to kind of not matter um all right why don&#39;t we do a couple merch messages uh watch we can explain how they work real quick uh the way to interact with the show which I guess is I mean are Luke and Dan are you guys going to stick around a little while longer you&#39;re not obligated to but like prob try get through the merch messes I sent you a message on teams L but yeah we we can we stay for a bit but yeah I I think just to speak on the ryzen topic for a quick second I totally agree everyone&#39;s waiting for x3d I think that&#39;s what basically every reviewer told people to do I think the the the coolness of 99000 Series in in the areas that it does matter is extremely minor and no one really cares and the the sales that have gone to it have probably been non gamer just people building a new computer and it&#39;s just the thing that happens to be out and that&#39;s it I think that&#39;s all the sales dude if I if I was doing like the the trunk computer for my like car gaming setup again I&#39;d probably put 9,000 Series in it sure just cuz like extra well you know right right it&#39;s niche but like the extra heat really matters there yeah but again x3d chips are so efficient too I I would just be waiting for the next x3d series 9000 x3d is going to be oh I hate making predictions these days I think 9000 x3d is going to be really good though I&#39;m I&#39;m actually kind of stoked I hope I I hope I get to be right because like I I just want cooltech to talk about that if I&#39;m biased by anything it&#39;s that I&#39;m biased to like have something cool to talk about and like play with um all right merch messages all you got to do is throw something in your card on LTD store.com send us a merch message we don&#39;t really do super chats or quick twitch bits oh that close or twitch bits or or any of that stuff it&#39;s better if you&#39;re going to throw many at your screen that you&#39;re going to get some highquality merchandise in the one of our 50% off water bottles that we&#39;re running for the next little bit while we clear out the ones with the old lid design um you can also um back order a Precision screwdriver um and Dan if you want to show people how merch messages work they go into the queue to be responded to later Dan will reply to them now or he will throw them to the show for to respond to in real time Dan hit me sure I got a bit of a juicy one here we&#39;re not going to do too many hey lld any thoughts on the threemile island nuclear plant coming back online with an exclusive delivery deal with Microsoft dystopian or green power for power hungry AI That&#39;s face I made I got it I actually I actually hadn&#39;t heard about this and I was so on board because nuclear power has this like bad rap that just needs to stop um like it&#39;s not perfect nothing is perfect but good Lord compared to just like burning fraking coal like it&#39;s the Industrial Revolution like are you kidding me Bas we at war or not I was like this sounds I was like this sounds fair enough I was like this sounds great um until you said the last part and then I thought back to that Hydro power plant in BC that apparently is dedicated to running a crypto Farm and I was like man really like really yeah yeah yeah yeah I don&#39;t know I hadn&#39;t heard about this uh I don&#39;t know really it&#39;s better than burning coal unless there&#39;s an act of War yeah yeah but like this isn&#39;t replacing any of the dirty power that like we&#39;re producing for things people actually need this is just oh yeah yep well wait is this for is this for Microsoft yeah so I mean they were going to do something so it&#39;s either build a coal plant or do this because there there&#39;s there&#39;s all these projections right now of the power generation that the states is going to have and how it&#39;s going to change over the next coming years and how it&#39;s going to massively outpace um previous Productions and y y y so this power increase is going to come from somewhere um so I understand what you&#39;re saying where like we&#39;re not we&#39;re not replacing like heating people&#39;s water with coal um but they were going to make it somehow um all right so it&#39;s either more coal plants new ones or this or something else I don&#39;t know right there&#39;s there&#39;s all different options how about we oh okay well okay you know what fine if this is a if this is a thawing of The Frigid enthusiasm that there&#39;s been around nuclear power for a while then then I then I&#39;m happy there yeah okay Dan hit me sure oh geez let&#39;s see lonus I thanked my wife for make uh for doing my laundry as you said any news about the moist pocket thank you for solving my problems greeting from Belgium and my wife I forget what the moist pocket even is I think it was in a pair of pants you designed like an internal pocket the I dude I say random stuff all time I do remember this there was like a a zippered internal pocket a pair of sweatpants or something like that water resist moist pocket oh it was like s just like cuz if you just have like a sweaty ass then I guess like your stuff won&#39;t get wet um it might be a typo they are from Belgian and there&#39;s Samar yeah I I think I was eting guys I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a moist pocket any pocket can be a moist pocket yeah I mean nothing&#39;s impossible but not today not today I am oh I am wearing the new cargo pants though if you if you do have one see me right now don&#39;t call it that um yeah yeah there cargo pants all totally normal Pockets yeah lots of them though lots of moist Pockets lonus how are you doing for timing you have five minutes over now I believe you still okay uh I need to go in like 5 minutes okay can do uh question for lus with your tyan what&#39;s your opinion on Porsche&#39;s new EVS updated tyan Manan EV 718 EV will you buy a new Porsche EV in the future why or why not it&#39;s funny my nickname for my car is the taant because it like has issues with it sometimes um it&#39;s been recalled like four times or something like that overall though I love driving my car uh like Luke has heard me talk about it a fair bit like outside of wow uh that is a that is a happy purchase the acceleration is you know not the most important thing for killing it at the track and whatever but I I um I like driving around in something that literally accelerates the way the incred coaster does at California Adventure Park um my kids love it they&#39;re always like do launch control do launch control you know like it&#39;s I I enjoy it I like my car um I do want to test drive the Maan just because I&#39;m like kind of curious I uh I have no interest in the 718 I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t even really understand Porsche&#39;s lineup like it it doesn&#39;t really makes sense to me like the whole 911 91 something like I I don&#39;t understand like the different generation nomenclature I&#39;m not really a car guy I just I just like my car um but yeah I want to test drive the Maan I&#39;m curious about it uh the new tyan the main benefit that would affect me because it&#39;s all like oh it has better driving Dynamics I&#39;m like sure yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m not going to take this thing to the track so the main benefit to me would be the better range but the range doesn&#39;t bother me on mine I don&#39;t road trip in it who would road trip well okay someone might it&#39;s actually very very daily drivable um but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t road trip so it doesn&#39;t bother me there that&#39;s all I have to say about that okay sort of two more for you he L&#39;s excited to get my hoodie but I noticed I can only buy mystery color anyways I was wondering if you had any advice what would you give to a high schooler in grade nine thank you for all you do n take every course you can for free because Education costs a fraking ton of money the second you graduate from high school yeah but not just academics I took like metal art and jewelry and it was like hugely you never know when something is going to come in handy like we my my wife and I did a did a like a make your own earrings class on a weekend and we made her a pair of earrings that&#39;s like you know special and Handmade by us we each made one and they kind of match but kind of don&#39;t so they&#39;re you know very handcrafted like that and taking metal art and jewelry was really useful for me being more decent at it you like I don&#39;t know you never know just like broaden your horizons keep your horizons Broad do all of it hey have you considered doing a follow-up on EXT extreme Tech upgrades to see what people regretted or would have done differently thanks we have thought about that as a float plane exclusive um but we should definitely note it Dan if you don&#39;t mind forwarding that to as a reminder to Sammy um it&#39;d be great to to get that series rolling speaking of float plane exclusives Luke we have 37,000 subscribers on Flo plane nice we did not make it oh we didn&#39;t make it never mind 37,9 68 sorry brother oh when we get one more it&#39;ll be cool that&#39;s a sub goal that&#39;s a sub goal that I like a lot if we get one more I&#39;m happy sorry we got we got about half of the way there all right cly goal um no it&#39;s not did did you say oh yeah I&#39;m going to forward that to Sammy that&#39;s all I&#39;ve really got for you lonus I do have one message here that I got privately um apparently it&#39;s map&#39;s wedding day today yes oh wow yeah yeah congrats M uh long time long time um member of our community especially over on the Forum uh congratulations I really hope you aren&#39;t watching the show right now I&#39;ve got a so we&#39;ll see you in the VOD we&#39;ll see you in the VOD buddy congratulations we apparently got one more by the way on float plane Luke oh ni we are at 37 969 so something thank that&#39;s something for you thank you whoever did that I appreciate it thank you uh the rest of these are probably good for Luke if you want to uh leave us alone get out of here I&#39;m going to a play I&#39;ll see you guys in person next Friday right okay have fun enjoy it okay um okay and I&#39;m just going to do this in advance I&#39;ll see you again next time uh next week same bad time same bad Channel and then Luke you can just have a super delayed uh that thing you do don&#39;t say bye cuz I&#39;m contract obligated to immediately end the outro if you do that yeah don&#39;t do it Luke don&#39;t do it do it don&#39;t I know not even a j stop it stop it you can&#39;t do it I know it&#39;s a reflex oh okay keep everyone on seat all right let&#39;s do it we&#39;re not going to we&#39;re not going to do this forever but I got a couple more we yeah we&#39;ll fire through the rest of the merch messages and then probably get out of here I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to do any topics we&#39;ll just move those to next week there&#39;s some really good topics there&#39;s some really juicy ones yeah um so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll talk about that next week but yeah we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get the rest of the merch messages and then and I can actually send Sammy a message and he&#39;s still at work it&#39;s not 10 p.m. yeah followups FP exclusives okay uh let&#39;s see hi Luke who have you recommended cyber security con uh who are your recommended cyber security content creators I haven&#39;t found many that aren&#39;t purely educational besides darket Diaries purely educational uh like I I think he wants like LTT but cyber security we broke into a bank and stole on their money uh I I think my my the there&#39;s a bunch that I I watch kind of on and off I&#39;m not very good at remembering names so that this isn&#39;t going to be awesome for that uh but low-l learning and John Hammond are ones that I frequently go back to I got to remember I&#39;m looking over here now right yeah there yeah there we go uh lowle learning and John Hammond are are ones that I will I will frequently go back to um there&#39;s other people that you know talk about it like even even Thor or um pirate software will will talk about cyber security stuff sometimes um there are a bunch of other cyber security creators that I watch outside of those two as well but um yeah I don&#39;t know yeah I&#39;ll go with that yeah without like bringing up my YouTube and finding them uh those are the ones that I&#39;m remembering off top of my head right now so that are now LTT Stables uh I don&#39;t know how many still are um kick farted was uh a thing of mine which kind of died alongside Kickstarter um it&#39;s not not as popular anymore so that oh Dan was muted Dan say it again do it again gosh darn it hey LDL gavon from the Netherlands Luke in a previous W show you&#39;d mentioned that scrapyard Wars was rally pitched by you did you pitch any other Concepts that are now ldt Staples yeah quite a few of them have died off is essentially what I&#39;m saying so we had Tech showed down um which I thought was amazing I thought the content was fantastic um but people didn&#39;t really watch it so we had Tech Showdown one which was candy battle um we had candy battle part two which got even less views candy battle went all the way to part four that might be part of the reason why cuz that was a one-day shoot that we moved into four videos and all the thumbnails were literally identical except for the part number changing that might have impacted it to a certain degree Tech Showdown the pixel PC thing was fantastic but they in general just um didn&#39;t get a ton of views um Tech shown and scrapyard wars were the two that were like very much me most the rest of them were collaborative think tanks if that makes sense um like even Tech quickie um I had something to do with the original ideation of that that because I remember I remember going to Best Buy and taking pictures of all the labels trying to get inspiration for for some of the really early episodes um I don&#39;t know yeah a lot of a lot of the the things that have been on the channel for a really long time recurring themes um I might have been a part of ones that I know I wasn&#39;t was like the ultimate Tech upgrades the Intel or AMD ones I had nothing to do with any of that uh um I don&#39;t know secret shopper I had nothing to do with yeah a lot a lot of the old school stuff um I would have at least been a part of pitching it um I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a long rambly answer but yeah Tech Showdown and scrap red wars were the main ones that were just like only really me at the beginning like when it was pitched for the first one and then from there it it usually moved on to other people like the most recent scrap Wars I I didn&#39;t do anything to plan it literally at all I didn&#39;t even know what the theme was I didn&#39;t know anything going into it um that was all other people so they&#39;ve they&#39;ve kind of passed on from my hands now but yeah hey D I am uh working cyber security professional for a similar sized company as yours how do you manage people&#39;s expectations when going through the transition of being ad hoc startup to corporate Luke just implodes yeah um [Laughter] Li isn&#39;t here you you&#39;re you&#39;re okay it&#39;s a it&#39;s a problem for a bunch of reasons it&#39;s a problem internally and it&#39;s a problem externally um I don&#39;t know how many companies have as much light on them externally as we do um but um cough cough let&#39;s look at the lab for a second um people seemed to assume that you know almost in instantaneously upon the lab existing our our testing was going to be at um some new level just overnight um and I I think that created a lot of pressures which those pressures were a little bit antithetical to some of the ideas of of how the lab should have worked which created the cyclical problem where they just anyways uh that created a bunch of issues both internally and externally um I think I I love the like when when like the YouTube channel gets hacked back in the day uh and people are like what channel that got hacked as if as if that has anything to do like as if we&#39;re cyber Security Professionals for one and then for two as if everyone in the company is like what are you talking we set a fire a computer on fire the other week to like make it cool down we don&#39;t do cyber security yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot a lot of like really weird expectations come from people that have often no idea what they&#39;re talking about um I had them before I started here I was super intimidated that everybody here was going to be a computer expert and you have me coming in doing tech support and it&#39;s like hi my computer&#39;s broken and I&#39;m like oh God here we go like over the monitor was turned off they&#39;re just all like experts at their like it&#39;s a joke right like actually happen here oh yeah I think it was unplugged slightly like the power cable was half unplugged which is fine but like you know they&#39;re all experts at doing their thing yeah not necessarily experts do so much stuff dude we&#39;re we so many companies stuffed into one straight jacket 11 or straight jacket uh straight jacket feels accurate we are in separate coat coffin no yeah we I don&#39;t know want to suck your tips we do we do so many things we we not only is there a merch company but they actually like engineer and develop their own stuff and tools and crazy things like that that&#39;s an entire massive company potentially by itself this video platform thing uh we have the the content creation arm we have our own business team sad of farming it out we have our own editors instead of farming it out we have our own accountants instead of farming it out we do so much stuff we have the lab we have Logistics we have procurement we have like I I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing uh the half the company somehow there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s stuff you you handle everybody&#39;s like backline stuff right the teams and the Google and the oh infrastructure yeah that either we&#39;ve got Global infrastructure and local infrastructure yeah that&#39;s true we have cloud and local we do we do so many things it&#39;s ridiculous we got Enterprise data storage collections people are like you have 100 employees we&#39;re in a company of 100 jobs this thing must be perfect and it&#39;s like well no we don&#39;t have 100 employees working on that we have one yeah and then 100 other jobs yeah cuz we&#39;re 11 companies which is awesome like I think it&#39;s one of the of the things that people really like about working here is there&#39;s so much going on all the time and there&#39;s so much potential for you to do different things within the company like it&#39;s it&#39;s all cool things but it creates sometimes I think a misconception of from from certain other people about how things work around here um how how could they make this one small mistake they have a hundred people to prevent it it&#39;s like no we we don&#39;t we do a lot of different things also we release an incredible amount of content and are human so maybe chill out for for a second speak for yourself um I am a robot um I a meat popsicle but yeah managing expectations I think um one of the best things you can do and I I&#39;ll word it this way because it usually gathers more people&#39;s attention but one of the best things that you can do is lie about timelines what I really mean is one of the best things you can do is be realistic about timelines but everyone involved whether it&#39;s software developers whether it&#39;s building contractors whatever they all think that everything&#39;s going to go perfectly and that they&#39;re going to get it done at this optimistic and and realistic looking timeline and then not everything goes perfectly and it takes twice as long and this happens every time so just get the timeline suggestion from whoever you&#39;re working with and just double it and then it&#39;s probably accurate it&#39;s not you&#39;re you&#39;re lying about the timeline but you&#39;re actually not you&#39;re being being realistic understanding that things are going to go wrong that when you&#39;re building bespoke things when you&#39;re when you&#39;re working on new stuff when you&#39;re not just turning up the same thing over and over and over and over again in a very practiced and measured way then stuff happens things don&#39;t fit to schedule so you need your schedule to be malleable so you can deal with that the best way to manage expectations in my experience is uh the extremely old saying of under promise and overd deliver don&#39;t set the expectations too high and if people have expect expectations that are too high despite that meet with them and try to bring those expectations back down to reality because um it&#39;ll just be better for everyone so yeah anyways okay what else we got hey lonus Luke and the talent and old W talked about whale tier float plane Subs with free merch have you considered a tier that gives store credit monthly Luke would it be easier to have one bird or nine Birds are these the same question there&#39;s two questions okay I think one of them I don&#39;t know answer both of them I don&#39;t I don&#39;t care all right pick pick one your birds a float plane subscription that gives you store credit sounds super weird to me is you&#39;re giving us money to give you money I don&#39;t know maybe people would like that it would be like you buy a float plane subscription and you get a gift card yeah yeah essentially but like is that good do you want that discount in the store I don&#39;t know we&#39;ve got some plans there&#39;s some cool plans coming up for for flow plane LTT store collaboration um eventually I kind of want it to go the other way around I have this idea we are not close to this we are not currently working on this do not ask me in 3 weeks when is this feature coming it might never happen Okay no I&#39;m setting expectations I&#39;m doing what I just talked about Leave Me Alone um but I think it would be cool if maybe eventually we thought about potentially working on a system where when you buy merch on LTT store you get float plane subscription time and if you currently have a float plane subscription it essentially just like buffers back your renew date so like uh say you&#39;re you&#39;re you know you&#39;re super into the mer mer and you really like the content on Flow plane and you buy a bunch of stuff in LTD store and you&#39;re actively subscribed with a credit card on Flow plane well buying stuff on LTG store would like push back when you have to get build again on Flo plane if that makes sense um or would just every time you buy something on Flo plane store uh on LTD store maybe you just get a little bit of Flo plane time for free and you you weren&#39;t previously subscribed I think both of those are pretty interesting use cases we are far from that being a thing I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll ever be a thing etc etc etc stop please leave me alone um there are many other things are working on before then but I think Bridging the two in a variety of ways is cool um I think a lot of the people that like things from LTT store are probably similar people to the people that like Flo plane um so I like the idea of somewhat of a collaboration between the two platforms um but uh for a variety of reasons you know both of them not originally being built with that in mind uh it&#39;s not necessarily the easiest thing ever but would be cool for people and is something that we are definitely interested in doing um someday sometime not soon go away uh and then is it easier to have one bird or nine uh it&#39;s definitely easier to have one bird but I would highly suggest that you have two um not nine and not one birds are flock animals and if you are not literally home all the time um then they&#39;re going to feel abandoned by their flock which is bad so you want to give them a little buddy and then nine Birds sounds like an incredible amount of work to deal with um one bird or nine Birds is a yard reference I think oh well I haven&#39;t been keeping up with my my yard listening so maybe I don&#39;t know the reference but yeah there we go is there any more I got two more for you here then I got to get think new what I see I don&#39;t play Pokemon go the way a lot of people play it so I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t play as much in in like I don&#39;t pay as much attention to the updates and stuff I was muted again God somebody asked me what I think about the new update to Pok\u00e9mon go what do you think I don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re talking about if they&#39;re talking about the Dynamax thing yeah I think so uh it seems kind of neat actually because I like that the Dynamax locations are not super far apart I do think most Min Maxi gamers are going to interpret this as oh I should get in my car and drive to all of these um which sucks a lot but I would hope that people notice that there&#39;s a limited amount that you can do every day so as long as you have the time you might as well just go walk to them and then they&#39;re close enough that it&#39;s fairly reasonable to walk from point to point um so I&#39;m using it as a walking thing if that&#39;s the update that they&#39;re talking about uh then yeah I think it&#39;s generally a good thing it incentivizes getting out there and getting new stuff because your old catalog of Pokemon are useless in that Arena um and hopefully it gets people out walking if it does not result in you walking I think it is a bad feature that you should ignore in regards to playing Pokemon go because I will yet again say that I think Pok\u00e9mon go itself the game is actually terrible um but as mechanism to get you outside and walking it is god tier it is it is both of those at the same time all right next up okay Luke as a man who drives cars until I get in as a man who drives cars until I get the best tradein value by pushing it to the scrapyard I understand your love of the current car have you thought about what comes after The Magic Smoke not really um pretty much All My Hope has gone into uh Acura releasing a um a plug-in hybrid version of the like what are they on right now TLX or whatever um that&#39;s been a hope I hope they do it soon so that by the time I want to buy it I can get a used one that&#39;s a few years old um yeah I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t put a ton of thought process into it I don&#39;t love straight EVS um at these days I don&#39;t love straight ice cars either I really like the idea of plug-in hybrids I I have driven my my girlfriend&#39;s uh Prius Prime plug-in hybrid a few times and the main problems that I have with it are that it&#39;s just like I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t fit in that car as well as I do in mine which is what brings me back to wanting an Acura because I have never been in a car that feels too as like naturally comfortable to me as my car does um so I like the idea of hopefully they still feel that way and I can get a new one um not brand new you know a new to me um and then better not I&#39;m leaving right now if you yeah yeah don&#39;t worry dead to me you have permission to take me out um yeah I but but having the the power and efficiency of a plug-in hybrid cuz like the power dude when you put it on like use both trains mode dang most supercars are hybrid now yeah and and there&#39;s a new one that came out which is like the first 30 km an hour 30 m an hour full electric until the engine&#39;s Peak torque comes in and then it&#39;s like unlimited power so sick forever so sick and then the ability you still have infinite range CU you can fill up at pumps whenever you want but you have that efficiency of if you&#39;re just commuting to working back you can probably just plug it in like plug-in hybrids are peak in my opinion so both if I am able to get a plug-in high if if I could just take my current car and assume the frame is in perfect condition and stuff which I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not if I can assume all that stuff is fine if I could just literally have the shell of my car but it was a modern plug-in hybrid engine that was in the performance category that my car is in I would be super stoked which is why I&#39;m just hoping that they Acura eventually does that so that I can get the closest possible thing to what I currently have but with a modern plug-in hybrid you pay me for that I&#39;ll do it find the engine we got a rusted out one we got a rusted out one I&#39;ll I&#39;ll do that that sounds like a fun car project oh man we get salmon over here we&#39;ll drift it be sick so that&#39;s all I got yeah okay uh thanks for watching thanks for watching the extended period uh we&#39;ll see you next week all those fun exciting things um bye

gigantic bag of discount no-name potatoes Welcome Home the crazy cat lady Vibes are so strong yeah I have three that&#39;s why I bought an automatic litter box the good news is the way Elija likes to put extra holes in things should make this the fastest upgrade ever if if you know what I mean oh that&#39;s not my fault please don&#39;t break my house in all seriousness though his setup is already pretty good like we could be out of here by lunchtime all he wants to do is improve his streaming stuff so bit of a faster computer there and some new webcam there and what is that pile why do you have a Minecraft mini fridge that&#39;s just for decoration I&#39;m also building a brand new Nas moving my current computer into another case building a brand new gaming system we&#39;re all putting it in a server rack machine and oh and I did get that litter robot this is going to be an issue it&#39;s 10:37 we&#39;ve only got minutes till your shift ends well we better get going I can claim overtime thanks AMD [Music] AMD is here again to give you guys a chance to win one of three Rog Alli X&#39;s with Final Fantasy 16 powered by one of amd&#39;s best mobile chips the Alx is perfect for gaming on the go especially with its 80w hour battery all you have to do is head down to the description and follow the link for your chance to win thanks AMD for sponsoring this series before we get started find oh man there is so much to unpack in here did you not realize you had a Funko Pop problem when you started needing to put them sideways to fit them on your wall like you kept buying them also more importantly why do you hate Apple Jack what do you mean where&#39;s Apple Jack I couldn&#39;t find Apple Jack these are really tough to find by the way excuses oh my goodness any true collector would have Applejack that&#39;s true all right I&#39;ll buy it on eBay no no I&#39;m is joke oh I don&#39;t want to be judgmental here but you waste so much money on what the is this these are I know what they are you you were asking I was trying to help I thought you didn&#39;t know I know what an amido is and I know how much they cost yeah no wonder you have to steal things from the office I have stolen nothing really like this uh that was a gift from from who from Ryan and Creator Warehouse thanks Ryan I don&#39;t know if he paid for it and this that one I paid for I used my employee budget okay there&#39;s no way you actually bought a belfine keyboard that has got to be the one from short circuit I bought it before I found out we were getting one for short circuit you bought a bathwater keyboard I have good reasons my keyboard was breaking I like collector&#39;s edition things and I wanted a keyboard in that color scheme it was great it was a good deal 1,000% stoen well that&#39;s it&#39;s all part of the upgrade it&#39;s like backup stuff just in case we don&#39;t need it or we do need it you know but yeah stolen like he went and took these off of our set deck so he could have the limited edition ones they were in the generic bin backup I bet $1,000 they were in the generic Vin I paid for every single one of those this has never been for sale I found a black shaft in a bin when we were allowing employees to make custom screwdrivers and I took it cuz it&#39;s a number two pencil see got the lead yellow yellow and pink for the Eraser this is just the stuff he had on display no you&#39;re not allowed going in there I&#39;m I&#39;m dead serious wife will don&#39;t you dare wife will kill me please don&#39;t I&#39;m not look I&#39;m not looking okay Taylor will crack the whip yeah she&#39;s scary oh my God two whale plushies there&#39;s no way uh yeah I paid for one uh-huh why do you have mini PCS oh those are from my just on display those are for my old job I tried to make a cluster out of nucks and I I was going to call it the cluster knck but I never got to it I had like 10 at one point oh my God there&#39;s more Funko Pops yeah you need to stop I have like how much does that cost last I checked it was like 180 Canadian I think we need to do a David style intervention with him no no please I mean I could pay off like every ounce of debt I have if I sold them you should not own Funko pops and debt well no it&#39;s it&#39;s for when the building burns down I&#39;m waiting for the insurance payout are they even insured yep well I have home insurance on the the content in the home and like it you know it you know it it&#39;s part of L it&#39;s it&#39;s okay we have three computers to build mhm I was thinking we could give Colin the nas he could just kind of work on it on the counter back there I think he&#39;s capable and then you and me can fight over who builds the brand new gaming PC or has to transplant that computer I&#39;m not fighting you okay which one would you like to do I hate your case so much he came to a land at my place he brought this stupid thing takes up like half the table so often I want to ask like what&#39;s wrong with you don&#39;t answer that okay I was going to say it&#39;s going to be a while yeah like you have a razor chair who buys this look at it it&#39;s so broken the metal is shearing I will fall over and it will break one day you know it&#39;s bad for your back hey yeah it&#39;s fine I&#39;m buying a new chair next month I was already 2K over budget so I couldn&#39;t fix uh a chair into it drop a like on this video and leave leave a comment if you think it&#39;s time for Elijah to sell his  Funko pops while they&#39;re still worth anything get himself an ergonomic chair and pay off his Funko Pop debt well since you hate that case so much I think you should transplant I&#39;ll transplant the gaming PC I will build a new one we&#39;re giving call in the NZ calling you good he&#39;s good yeah okay cool and then what are you doing I&#39;m going to build the brand new gaming PC why do you need two gaming PCs well cuz that one&#39;s becoming a dedicated capture SL streaming PC and then I&#39;m building a brand new gaming PC so it doesn&#39;t have to deal with the overhead of streaming you already have a capture card yeah but this one does two inputs so because I&#39;m getting a new camera Sony zve E10 which HDMI please tell me with the amount that you&#39;re spending on streaming stuff that you actually make money at it yes the amount that I&#39;m over twitch this year has covered it essentially all right there you go oh my God don&#39;t don&#39;t knock over dream machine don&#39;t knock over my Bel doine mouse pad here Colin I would ask you to help him but I think he&#39;s sort of beyond that are these refurbished hard drives uh I stole them out of my old client&#39;s server they&#39;re like from 2012 they were recycling it I was like hey they&#39;re perfectly good 4 terabytes editor can you roll the clip where he said how much stuff he stole I have stolen nothing that was a gift I found a black shaft in a bin this is borrowed yeah I have a third one too but yeah stolen oh my God since this is just the gaming PC 7800 x3d basically like the fastest gaming CPU right now until maybe 9,000 Next 3D chips but we&#39;ll wait and see it&#39;s all going to be sitting on this b650 auror Elite ax you spent too much on your motherboard I did but it has 2.5 gig land which is what I want because I&#39;m going to get a 2.5 gig switch down the road as well as the io is freaking just stacked on this thing so I&#39;m that&#39;s why I chose it I went with gskill Flare X5 ddr5 Ram running at 6,000 cl30 I don&#39;t know 32 gigs total that&#39;s more than enough for a gaming PC right your upper lip sweats when you get nervous yes you called out my sweating in the last video there was not a small amount of comments were like how dare you call out a human for sweating lonus dude there&#39;s no way you&#39;re sweatier than me anyway I went with the two terab Kingston nv2 this is taking forever yeah well I&#39;m working on it bucko and then the Assassin x 120 refined okay cooler is so cheap I love it remember how we gave Logistics crap in shad&#39;s upgrade for the cover falling Jamie said I put the socket cover on and then the date I noticed you didn&#39;t mention your GPU I assume that means you&#39;re going to keep using the one from the old rig yeah that&#39;s doing all of like the encoding for Twitch streaming wait well why do you have a secondary machine then What GPU you&#39;re going to have in there you don&#39;t have a GPU I bought the the yesen Sarai 7900 XTX this was $150 more than a normal 7900 XTX it&#39;s really pretty I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed how much the audience has loved you up until now that&#39;s fine they&#39;re cuz they&#39;re going to hate this you know what that&#39;s fine yeah even our camera I was going to wait for you to figure it out like brother it&#39;s going into a rack mounted computer that doesn&#39;t even have a window I&#39;ll know about it look how pretty that looks it&#39;s pretty oh pretty unnecessary oh my God God they put a window over the pass through heat sink finnage so this fan can&#39;t blow straight through the card yeah it can no it can&#39;t well it just get stuck at what point was I such a bad role model for you uh no hit me again what do you mean by wobbles it doesn&#39;t wobble what are you talking about well it was like drooping I think replacing this is a phenomenal waste of money I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll fit also yep you&#39;re replacing it I do need one of the ssds out as well oh sure because I&#39;m dual booting on my main gaming PC oh really are you going Linux Linux is going to be my daily but there&#39;s a handful of games that I still use that require anti-che and so that&#39;s going to have the windows drive and because it&#39;s a dual streaming setup I can reboot this computer without having to worry about the stream going down nice yeah okay that&#39;s pretty cool this is so overkilled dude you&#39;ve got 32 gigs of ram in here yeah a freaking 12 core processor yeah well that was my main gaming PC like like you could have flipped some of this stuff and gone with something more modest well no no that wouldn&#39;t be the Elijah way yeah never sell anything exactly where&#39;s your back plate for this I&#39;m going to need that let me go take a look all right the man who keeps everything accept his mounting hardware new plan the PC will be powered by cat Monty you&#39;re so cute here&#39;s our plan okay I install the old cooler again but I do it properly this time and then we just have a gap in the rack and it has no top panel installed I&#39;m fine with that that&#39;s actually what I was going to suggest so I hate that so much yeah well it&#39;s better than someone driving back to the office I haven&#39;t even commented on the fact that his TV is on that wall and his couch is on that wall how the do you watch TV like that so like is this how it&#39;s normally like this I moved out of the way just for the shoot sure I well I also have a VR headset we could set it up today you want then I have VR room but that&#39;s way over scoped we&#39;re already building three computers it&#39;s not like you need a room scale experience for what you&#39;re doing in it where&#39;s this tissue box stop bet it&#39;s I bet it&#39;s right there stop I have a wife I don&#39;t need to actually don&#39;t leave that in my wife would my wife would fing kill me no you dare leave that in oh you&#39;ve got the Precision that actually would be a more appropriate where did where did the screwdriver go I was like so scared for a second this is Kyle&#39;s personal so I got so worried uh Hey where&#39;s the mounting hardware for your case oh that&#39;s in the server rack oh my God I completely overlooked the server rack Facebook Marketplace $100 liking these cases pretty simple this is the same company that made that Cerberus little matx gaming saem that I have right sliger yeah that&#39;s yeah they they have multiple depths as well and different like options so you can actually get ones with 5.25 bays and other front IO and stuff I went with these because my server rack is pretty shallow so this is the shallowest they make this case and they actually don&#39;t sell Pink as one of the options oh they reached out and they were like hey we&#39;ve been wanting to send it to someone does the person who&#39;s getting the upgrade want it and I said hell yeah man these guys really don&#39;t mess around with the number of screws they include with this case look at this uh I need a power supply what am I using the old one oh right you&#39;re putting a 1200 WT 80 plus Platinum power supply in a freaking second AR computer I need the I want to make sure that this one never fails this one can&#39;t fail actually do you know which one did fail we just published the labs result for the one that&#39;s going in the NZ and it failed both stopped functioning before we completed our tests so we cannot recommend it oh hey there we go nice now I&#39;ve got enough room for your stupid Overkill power supply honestly hanging out with Elijah makes me so much more offended by just the exploitative sales tactics that companies use to get people to waste their money mhm I have this is who they&#39;re exploiting the face is this and the name is Elijah C for you am I putting the Elgato card in here no you we are putting where&#39;d it go the a media one okay so I&#39;m putting the live gamer duo in yeah okay it&#39;s got two inputs one can do 4K 60 or in my case 1440p 120 and one we&#39;ll just do 1080p60 which is perfect cuz for my webcam basically perfect I&#39;m pretty close to done this build I guess they didn&#39;t include any fan screws though right just about to put in fans well just zip tie them that&#39;s what Colin&#39;s doing what no yeah just take the lean Lee ones and zip tie them but no those are I thought you were telling me take the lean Lee ones to get the screws from them no no no why are all of your fans zip tie cuz I didn&#39;t have any [Laughter] screws I&#39;m getting that weird head I get where like I&#39;m light headed from how stupid something is like that&#39;s a special headache Elijah you&#39;re welcome I also got these two 27in Dell monitors they do 75 HZ 1080p these are just going to be for my streaming computer on the side so that way I can like watch OBS and chat so then I will take my current monitor situation and I have another similar stand that we&#39;re going to do on the other side so then I&#39;ll have five monitors total I have all the screens it booted oh you finished with the nas perfect it does does have display ports but the CPU that&#39;s in here the 5,500 doesn&#39;t actually support onboard Graphics so we&#39;re not going to be able to get a display on it but I did pre-install the SSD it&#39;s configured so once we connect Network to it we&#39;ll be able to see our nashar but we can see at least if it boots up oh she so we got our fan filter nice these will definitely stay dust and cat hair free or at least they would if this was going to have a top on it well we&#39;re going to just lay the top on top like we just like yeah okay are we putting this in there or what yeah Elijah are you going to put any of the PCI covers in no I don&#39;t it&#39;s extra air flow no it&#39;s going to take so long take some pride in your work Mama Mia that&#39;s a spiciest spaghetti oh my God it looks so bad back here so these are all the peripherals for my streaming PC so like my stream deck my go XLR there look how much more quality that looks it&#39;s going to be in the server you&#39;re not even going be able to see it use zip ties to install your fan so that&#39;s all we need to know about you okay where does this one go on the bottom that goes on the lower one y she&#39;s at bottom do you need help um let&#39;s say no I said no I&#39;m sorry there we go there you go it&#39;s got a little she&#39;s a Lippy boy no move your hands move your hands you don&#39;t want your hands in there wow look at that you can fit so much computer in this bad boy okay where&#39;s the next one come plus no oh so C done you&#39;re get didn&#39;t you adopt more cats recently I have five now holy like I said I have some collections myself isn&#39;t that a great pink this is a great pink move your hands it was in oh totally scraping my paint thank you hey now we&#39;re racking boys time for the navs Colin you closed it up well we got we got to show the people what&#39;s ins if he wasn&#39;t so funny all the things he says I don&#39;t think we&#39;d put up with having him around that&#39;s true goon cave I thought we took the pin back how&#39;d you get it I blame you I don&#39;t know wait you didn&#39;t hook up all your backplane that&#39;s fine I only have eight available because of this LSI card okay so this is really practical then you can get LSI cards that could do four of these cables to do 16 drives this does 10 3.5s and 4 2.5S right so you should gotten one of those then I should have you need another fan these cards are not designed to sit here with absolutely nothing on like they got a little heat sink on them because they are expecting to be in a server or workstation with a lot of airf flow you need a fan here okay well good thing I grabbed the noons oh shoot I used them all uh solve your problem thank you what is this one it&#39;s from your air cooler that we didn&#39;t use oh okay cool a realistically steal more fans from work don&#39;t do that Alex gave me permission Alex doesn&#39;t own them he&#39;s in charge of the inventory he&#39;s in charge of protecting the inventory so he knows what he can let slip by do you want to know what he sold me well I have two computers now right so that would in turn mean I need two keyboards and two mice this is why he doesn&#39;t want me going into that room so I bought the original belfine keyboard kit from inventory um so you have two of them now well yeah I have one of each she looks all innocent but she&#39;s a predator you know that right why she Praise on well people like you that&#39;s fine I&#39;ll take it there that&#39;s kind of like yeah that&#39;s good enough it&#39;s good enough I swear he puts more time and Research into things when he like produces videos for you guys he cares a lot do you remember our first video nope what are you planning to store on this I shouldn&#39;t ask actually forget it forget I asked no I no you stream that you don&#39;t need to store that on hard drive yeah exactly I also record a backup of every stream because you can record out of OBS at a higher bit rate than twitch allows you to upload to so then you get a higher quality source file look at that they don&#39;t go all yeah this is as far as they go uh no I&#39;m so triggered right now okay fine then just do this oh no had you considered a KVM I considered it I didn&#39;t like the idea of it I wanted the second Bel doine keyboard a KVM would have allowed him especially one from Wendell those are super cool they&#39;ll do like quad monitors off of a single one so you can just switch between the computers and have the same set of peripherals monitor keyboard and mouse for both of them uh but instead he&#39;d rather clutter up his desk with more eirl merchandise yeah we need networking but I bought the dream machine SE oh that&#39;s cute foam yeah it&#39;s actually cool I like it how cute their foam is it&#39;s the cutest foam yeah I unironically play with it for 5 minutes at work when I unboxed the it acts as an NVR so you can have security cameras and all that it acts as a router it acts as a switch um it acts as a UniFi controller so you can add any UniFi devices you like without needing a cloud key or anything like that and it needs some ears yes where&#39;s your ears at right here where do you want it top uh right here nice look at that all right for $100 I think it&#39;s a pretty good price on our server rack yeah ow this you&#39;ll be proud of UPS yes I am proud that you have a [Music] UPS minus treat treat this with some respect dude dude oh I&#39;m taking this now do it do it yeah yeah yeah yeah did you know he had this no I had no idea I&#39;m giving it to Andrew I didn&#39;t know I had it Elijah you actually can&#39;t steal stuff from work I didn&#39;t know I had it what do you mean you didn&#39;t know you had it I probably choose your next words carefully I probably had it in my backpack cuz we went on a shoot where we needed it and I probably took it out of my backpack and forgot about it 100% I was thinking about criticizing his headphone choice but now I just don&#39;t have the energy anymore what what&#39;s wrong with it they&#39;re basic yeah that&#39;s why I bought them do you know what I was using before for the money you wasted on gamergirl crap you could have really nice headphones honestly I&#39;d rather use in ear these are $12 jbl&#39;s I&#39;d rather use them they&#39;re really uncomfortable have you ever worn these for an extended period time do you have anything nice to say like why do you come into everyone&#39;s house and immediately criticize everything no I&#39;m not criticizing that you&#39;re on a budget I&#39;m saying that for the money those cost they weren&#39;t that expensive 110 us all right for the money those cost you could have something legitimately comfortable they are comfy I find them comfortable and that won&#39;t fall apart well yeah that I don&#39;t know they&#39;ll no I do know okay well just buy new cups from Wicked cushions but now they don&#39;t cost 110 anymore do they oh I&#39;m going to save money by heating my pool with my computer that way I save money also line is literally floods his entire server room so he has to buy new computer gear okay no no no no I made money I made a video about it and I will [Music] stream one of the streaming angles I set up yeah is so that you can like kind of watch the living room we call that the FNAF cam or the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s camera uhhuh which is why I got the poe powered dream machine so I can put UniFi cameras nice and have them everywhere right how many monitors are you plan to I&#39;m going to have five well where do these ones go on the other side why do you need two on a secondary PC one for OBS and one for twitch why are you using your g502 well because that&#39;s my favorite Mouse well then why did you buy a Bel deline Mouse well it came with the set well why don&#39;t you sell it then because comes with the set so I&#39;m not going to break up the set what I actually don&#39;t think that looks very good what what the mouse pad or the keyboard I&#39;ll let you guys tell them what&#39;s wrong it&#39;s like a colorblind guy and did your interior design I like this this is looking good I just don&#39;t know what to do I don&#39;t understand what goal we&#39;re driving towards here he keeps saying we&#39;re doing a great job but I it feels like we&#39;re doing something illegal so now we need to do all the streaming stuff do you want to install my new camera sure okay grab my camera and grab the Elgato wall mount yes sir we&#39;re going to remove this foam panel we are and that&#39;s where the camera can go wow oh there&#39;s there&#39;s an extra hole in the wall who to thunk it while he&#39;s finding a stud finder we&#39;ve got the Elgato wall mount and a zv E10 which I have no idea anything about other than that it&#39;s a Sony camera and it comes with a lens and it&#39;s probably pretty good probably overkill for streaming and it does 4K I got my drywall anchors time to put some holes in Elijah&#39;s wall for a change okay do you have a hammer yeah okay $88,000 worth of Funko Pops no Hammer oh oh I got a hammer let&#39;s all get hammered there you go you use this to hammer something in I&#39;ll wait okay get it yeah buddy all right Elijah we got this I know we do I&#39;ve been confident the whole time hey I get it whole time because this is a lot of power in the rack I&#39;m drawing from two outlets so I&#39;m bringing a power bar all the way from over there and we&#39;re going to use our MCM just mounted up under the desk here these are the Key Bar holders hey magnetic Cable Management let&#39;s go lcg store.com baby I only got three of the anchors in without destroying them so this last screw is just cosmetic nice that&#39;s pretty good oh yeah buddy hey not bad not bad uh do you have a power adapter for that because I don&#39;t want the battery to swell up I actually bought a dummy battery off of AliExpress nice so then this will just go in there yep just to a USB which I have a wall wart somewhere that will plug in perfect and then there you go go I don&#39;t ruin my nice battery nice I need the HDMI from that camera mhm so that&#39;s just a mini HDMI to a full HDMI that&#39;s going to that a media capture card M mhm one thing that&#39;s really important with these micro HDMI connections is that you have some kind of strain relief on it we don&#39;t want the weight of this cable just hanging off of this connector because it will die it&#39;s not it&#39;s not if it&#39;s when um so what I&#39;d like to do is zip tie these guys onto the mount once we&#39;ve got it kind of locked in and then that way the the weight can hang off the zip tie putting Elijah&#39;s second graphic keyboard on his desk by the way there&#39;s almost certainly going to be stuff in this video that will not make the YouTube cut especially in light of us having one of our videos pulled recently so uh lmg Dogg flat plane Riley week is coming up do you have flesh Cutters at least I really do have my special headache though that I get from things being too stupid these scans like you can play who car well I I want you think if I wanted to make a limited edition stupid keyboard I couldn&#39;t yeah but you&#39;d spend four years developing it and call it the keyboard that one was personal okay I think that&#39;s everything plugged in other than power what did we even upgrade today what do you mean added another keyboard and a mouse that&#39;s it and two monitors a really nice camera this oh yeah we did a lot today yeah should we try and fire it up what suppos OD do you think they work yeah exactly tell me if I&#39;m running you over you&#39;re good you&#39;re good okay you can probably stop keep going okay I&#39;m plugged in oh there we go hey there we go see those fans those are the Le and Lee fans they&#39;re just screaming I probably just need to configure them here we go Bud here we go Bud we need the pass through from that capture card right that&#39;s the one yes I wonder if I need the a media stuff uh if you just want to go and give her a little check there bud oh I flicker oh I got three okay hey well that&#39;s great look at that that&#39;s great this actually kind of a sick config so 7800 x3d best gaming chip you got the 7900 XTX that you overpaid for because whatever and the point is that if you&#39;re running Windows and Linux going AMD is a great option for your GPU then over here you&#39;ve got your old system with the 12 core ryzen 3000 processor 32 gigs of RAM and a really good encoding card so that&#39;s your streaming machine and you know what I got to give you credit other than looking like it was you know aesthetically designed by a man um It&#39;s relatively clean yeah it looks sick mostly because I cleaned things thanks all right when I saw this at Walmart for $35 it&#39;s a mini fridge that is just in the shape of a creeper it holds 12 cans of pop I knew I had to have it I actually had bought another collector&#39;s fridge with Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 it&#39;s the Juggernog one over there it also fits 12 cans uh but it broke so I needed to replace my fridge I guess it is so flipping hot in here and this is not going to help but it looks really cool well it&#39;s a mini fridge I can just leave it open not how it works oh but in all seriousness the setup looks pretty good look Mom I&#39;m a streamer she&#39;s not proud audio is not working I&#39;m a streamer I&#39;m a I&#39;m a I&#39;m a streamer and I need to reconfigure it to all of the audio coming out of this one to make sure it&#39;s going to this OBS I haven&#39;t been able to do that yet because we were just getting it all working I can do that I don&#39;t want to spend any more time it&#39;s already I&#39;m in the OT time now you can&#39;t get OT for upgrading your own house uh yeah I can how does that work in the province of British Columbia employees are only mandated to work for a maximum 8 hours a day sup new camera who even needs a cameraman anyway when I can have three drywall anchors oh yeah you want to go look at the lit robot oh so you have the hopper I don&#39;t have the hopper yeah which generation do you have I have generation three okay so this is the fourth generation oo so there it is okay uh you got an error on it yeah they&#39;re still getting used to it but they have used it like basically right away and now I have an app so I get notifications at work every time they poop nice yeah and then the hopper you can kind of see it on the the back there yeah so it adds more litter every time they use it when it detects that it needs it it essentially is just like oh it&#39;s a little lower on weight puts a little bit more in that&#39;s actually kind of great cuz like topping up the litter is the only real work you have to do with it yeah great success does look good it thinks it&#39;s running at 4K too cuz we haven&#39;t quite configured a media and it&#39;s handling it like pretty good Beast yeah that&#39;s what you get when you get 7800 x3d and a 7900 XTX saarai Edition specifically the the sac Edition does not make it faster yeah it does no it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s like RGB it doesn&#39;t make your computer faster oh I don&#39;t know about that why else would I get it because you&#39;re gullible thanks AMD we managed to move his three machines to a rack which honestly ended up looking pretty freaking amazing we&#39;ve got these which is wonderful uh more monitors actually this is quite the battle station and this camera looks so much better than the garbage you had before and it was fine but this is way better this does low light and this apartment has you know not great lighting so this will be you&#39;re going to have to get the setting styled in a little bit this can do better than that oh 100% I&#39;m going to play with it after yeah we know you&#39;re going to play with it after look at this keyboard stop if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out Adams the

      "subtitles": "it&#39;s no surprise that the most popular controllers are first-party ones especially the modern Xbox controller and that makes a lot of sense it&#39;s a premium controller with a comfortable shape and it just works with all your modern PC games and even with other consoles like the Nintendo switch if you get the right dongle but what is a surprise is that in the dumpster fire of Cheaper alternative controllers are some downright excellent options with some of them going for less than $30 so we answered the title&#39;s question already it&#39;s this because it&#39;s good but what we haven&#39;t answered is what you should be buying and that is a bit more complicated unlike this simple segue to our sponsor nexo whether it&#39;s niow bonjour or hola the hello cam Pro from nexo is a reliable upgrade to your webcam setup thanks to its 1080p resolution 60 FPS frame rate and windows hello facial recognition pick it up at the link in the video description [Music] before we get to our Alternatives have you ever wondered why pretty much every modern PC controller shares that same familiar Xbox layout it turns out it&#39;s for some good reasons one being it&#39;s pretty ergonomic especially compared to some of its ancestors but the bigger one is xinput the xinput API will automatically bind compatible controllers to the right in inputs in your favorite games and while it&#39;s less versatile than the older D input standard which is still used especially for complex flight and racing rigs its limitations because of the standard Xbox layout allow it to be much more easily implemented strangely enough the second best-selling controller is the only D input controller that we&#39;re going to see today the ps5s Dual sense can it still be used for PC games short answer yes long answer yeah yes but it depends on how much tinkering you want to do four out of the five games that we tested needed some kind of manual remapping now there are wrappers like steam input or DS for Windows that will wrap the D input in an xinput container that should fix these issues and in games where the developers build in Native support for the Dual Senses extra features it is one of our favorite controllers especially in games that heavily make use of the d-pad we&#39;re going to have it and every controller we recommended from this video linked down below but enough about controllers that cost almost a 100 loonies I said that there are great controllers you guys are buying for $30 or less and this next one is not one of them the Logitech f310 has remained mostly unchanged since its release in 2010 making it probably our best fit for the title here because honestly guys why is every everyone still buying this controller it looks like a little brother Edition for the PS2 and honestly it feels like one too I mean is this really the best that Logitech can come up with I mean it&#39;s apparently kept at least 25,000 of you reasonably happy but look at the way the d-pad Jiggles and no they like that they love it I mean I guess if that&#39;s what you&#39;re used to there&#39;s also the wireless variant the f710 which is also pretty fine if you like your controllers to feel like a Brick In fairness The Price is Right at just 20 and $40 respectively and logitech&#39;s established reputation for warranty service sets them apart from many other competitors in this price class I mean only the best will do for billionaires who need to visit the Titanic of course while we&#39;re combing The Depths it&#39;s probably worth seeing if we can find something a little better oh here&#39;s a more recent top performer the 8bit do ultimate C has been sitting among Amazon&#39;s best sellers pretty consistently for months and is racking up four and a half star reviews at an incredible rate its MSRP is $30 with frequent discounts down to just 20 bucks and that is with a 2.4 GHz wireless dongle I mean that puts this whole package under the price of a Microsoft first-party dongle alone so it must be trash right I mean yeah Bo dude everything about it feels pretty good the shape is very similar to a regular Xbox controller I mean the d-pads nothing special but the face buttons feel really good even the triggers have a pretty satisfying feel to them and it has an integrated battery for that price that&#39;s something to consider guys Microsoft does include batteries with their controller but they&#39;re disposables not rechargeables and this has USBC charging with an integrated battery right out of the box I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the right choice for from a sustainability standpoint I&#39;m just saying it is a value ad and wait what&#39;s this I&#39;m getting reports of a brand new just released 8bit do ultimate 2C it comes in new multi-tone colorways and no way two extra shoulder buttons 1,000 HZ pulling rate and hall effect analog triggers and sticks meaning they should remain Snappy and precise long into the future guys this is a big upgrade so uh how much more is it going to cost it&#39;s the same price same price so wait why would I even buy that one the previous generation 8-bit do controller that had Hall effects was twice the price of the regular one and the only other benefits are Bluetooth and a charging dock they kind of thought of everything the edges are more round and comfortable in the hand especially at the edge of the shoulder and Trigger buttons the grip texture is less abrasive and feels a little less likely to collect a detailed his hisory of every skin cell that ever rubbed against it and while this spot where the face meets the textured back is a little bit on the sharp side that&#39;s not a part of the controller that you would ever naturally interact with the d-pad still not a star player but darn it they did put in some work to make it feel more tactile and even the face buttons feel just I don&#39;t know 8% more tactile oh the bumpers are clicky now dude I really like this thing it&#39;s even clicker than the regular Xbox controller which I may be bad or good depending on your preference but I like it of course I haven&#39;t actually played a game yet how does it stack up for actual gaming whoops oh how does the controller feel oh right the controller controller feels good brother really like the thumb sticks like the thumb sticks a lot very little dead zone I can&#39;t blame the thumbsticks for everything that&#39;s happening right now this is just hard do you want to try same game with the Logitech huh oh you want me to try the other controllers that makes sense can&#39;t say I&#39;m thrilled about it but uh yeah give me a sec dude I&#39;m still not that stoked on the uh on the face buttons okay that&#39;s good to know they&#39;re a little slow cuz in terms of input latency the 2C with the receiver was the lowest of everything we tested it&#39;s less the input latency and it&#39;s more how far they are to mash I just find that I I&#39;m having a little bit of more difficulty with them of course this the only it&#39;s only the first one that I&#39;ve looked at so maybe just side by side come on okay wait wait no we you&#39;ve tried this a 100 times with this one let&#39;s try the other controller all right maybe another controller is the answer oh my God this analog stick wow controller design has really come a long way in the last 14 years years um maybe we just go d-pad here yeah test what the people say I me realistically I&#39;m not doing any worse I think the cold hard truth is I&#39;m just not that good at Super Meat Boy you might have a little extra trouble with this one this controller actually has the highest tested input latency nothing is too unusable this is 23.5 milliseconds so it&#39;s still within the realm of that&#39;s okay yeah um but that&#39;s more than four times more than the 2C come on come on come on come on oh no way no way is the answer the Logitech controller maybe it&#39;s the repetition of doing it 100 times oh what are you doing what are you doing occasionally things will register a little funny but no big complaints it&#39;s oh it&#39;s really heavy actually it&#39;s really heavy does it use dou battery yeah yeah okay let&#39;s try a different game okay try a different game while I wait to fire up a racing game I can talk Comfort I do find the slightly more angled shape of the Xbox controller a little bit more comfortable for broader adult shoulders but if you like to kind of have your elbows tucked in I can see how this would actually be more comfortable for you everyone I talked to was really impressed at the build quality of this but people with big hands definitely find the Xbox controller more comfortable for I think the exact same reason you were saying the angle and they feel the same way about the 40 oz water bottle at LT store.com it&#39;s just wider for bigger hands than the 21 Oz you&#39;re 64 o yeah yeah okay now let&#39;s have a look at these triggers said drifty oo very small dead zones on the sticks do like isn&#39;t nice you&#39;re quite sensitive to dead zones hey I hate dead zones what&#39;s the point of moving a stick if it&#39;s not registered sir would you like a dead zone on your mouse no well then why do you accept it on your stick the thing is in racing games a lot of the times you don&#39;t want to over steer and having a big dead zone can cause you to over steer and then over steer the other way and then over steer the other way any deficiency in my performance here is 100% down to me not being very good at racing games I cannot blame the controller here like this control is extremely fine go go on go on get woo oh shoot I screwed it up I screwed it up right at the end how could I do this to myself whatever I Podium you want to try briefly with the Xbox one yeah yeah yeah yeah let&#39;s hook up the Xbox controller long story short we had an issue pairing with our dongle which normally is totally fine so I don&#39;t know exactly what happened here but I have a cable how do the sticks feel in this not as good they&#39;re sloppier triggers I honestly don&#39;t notice a huge difference with I&#39;ve never been that sensitive to them but the dicks on the Xbox controller they&#39;re not terrible but they&#39;re not as good in my humble observation we did test uh some of the controllers for the circularity of their analog sticks and the series one was actually one of the worst ones only the Logitech 310 was less circular but the labs didn&#39;t have a high degree of confidence cuz it might have just been that specific Xbox controller they tested question for you how many controllers does 8 bit do support off of a single dongle though I&#39;ve never checked I think it&#39;s just one you can&#39;t repair them I don&#39;t believe oh just one controller to a dongle that&#39;s a bit of a drawback especially when you consider that the Xbox dongle supports up to eight controllers off of a single dongle and has some extra quality of life features not to mention usually excellent pairing reliability though it should be noted that there is a latency cost there we actually found that the 8bit do 2C had the same latency on Bluetooth as the Xbox controller with its 2.4 GHz dongle and partially thanks to its 1000 HZ pulling rate absolutely obliterated the Xbox in a like for like test enough about the 2C though let&#39;s switch back to the 1C and see if the 2C is worth the extra $10 cuz so often this can be had for just 20 bucks I&#39;ll be honest with you it feels pretty good I don&#39;t notice a big difference I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible the sticks are a little bit looser but if they are it&#39;s not by much and the biggest difference for me that would make me still go with the 2C is the fact that it has bluetooth support it&#39;s just so convenient to not have to worry about dongles dang what an impressive controller but not everyone&#39;s going to feel the same way if you&#39;ve got much larger hands or if you have an Xbox and you want to move your controller between that and your PC wirelessly and seamlessly you might end up with a different option but I find this just a great balance of quality feeling d-pad quality face buttons great ergonomics I have a hard time imagining anyone who would hate this and realistically I could say the same about pretty much everything in front of me except for the f710 if you&#39;re looking at one of these no stop it it&#39;s time to retire old man and it&#39;s time for you to hear the

and kids anyway but then you notice the open box section Woo is that nearly 100 in of TV goodness for just 1,500 bucks take my money but on the way home you start to watch wonder what sacrifices had to be made to get a TV this big this cheap I mean surely it can&#39;t be 4K with support for HDR oh well there&#39;s no way it supports High refresh rate gaming oh okay does that too I mean but there&#39;s no way that it has a segue to to our sponsor really OD do their all-in-one business management Suite lets you dump your mismatching apps and unify your processes check the link in the description for a free 15-day trial and start running your business the way it deserves to be run if like us you find an openbox TCL 98 S550 GH the first complication is going to be getting it home this particular open box model wasn&#39;t available for delivery so we had to pick it up ourselves and TV&#39;s this big they&#39;re heavy but hey we got it here time to unbox it now Adam and I are are seasoned pros at unboxing giant TVs now so I&#39;m sure this is going to go very smoothly were you really cutting toward my face oh seasoned Pros we don&#39;t have to worry about safety we&#39;re so good at it hey this one comes with legs he mentions that because the 150 in one that I bought didn&#39;t okay we managed to open it backwards unfortunately uh okay all right I guess we&#39;re looking at the I/O first here&#39;s something that&#39;s a little confus using to me though what is it about a 100 in TV that allows it to be packaged relatively normally but the 115in TV which is know only this much bigger had to come in a crate I guess part of it is that the other one was thick she&#39;s a trunky boy yeah this is like half of the weight I think of your TV but it looks very similar in terms of the ID yeah it even has the the square pattern and then also Ultra base your TV can also work as a project mat like are these 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter it kind of looks like it they&#39;re Clos you could cut fabric patterns I need to know now for the io we got four HDMI ports the top one is 4K 144 Hertz which is weird cuz didn&#39;t the front of the box say 120 useless useless the squares are exactly 1 cm by 1 cm but then the gaps in between just throw the whole thing out of whack well I I&#39;m glad you figured out that mystery uh yeah so we&#39;re not really sure what the deal is with that the input&#39;s 144 Herz but the panel says native 120 maybe it&#39;s overclockable I guess we&#39;ll find out as for the rest of it it&#39;s pretty usual but uh it&#39;s weird to see a composite input on a modern TV still so that&#39;s nice one other unusual thing that I was about to point out before I realized that the back of the TV does this was the Vasa bolt pattern it&#39;s 500 mm x 6 00 mm so it&#39;s not square and because this thing is heavy what I would strongly recommend doing is something similar to what you guys saw me do in the cleanest Living Room Makeover where I put a big piece of wood just like a flat piece of plywood screw that into the studs and screw the mount for the TV into that since we&#39;re not doing any of that today we need to put the feet on H H how do we do that they said refer to the manual smart first get a table that&#39;s bigger than the TV where the hell am I supposed to get that soft cushion surface what is this look at this hypothetical soft cushioned thing that exists who has a giant cushioned table where are we going to put this here&#39;s the thing this video really was inspired by us just stumbling across this open box TV at what seemed like an unbelievable price at the time um so it doesn&#39;t have the little protective soft covering on the screen we don&#39;t really have a way of laying it down down I have an idea I have we we put there we go oh she&#39;s heavy yeah damn boy okay now I&#39;ve done this trick a lot of times where the air cushion that forms between the TV and the ground keeps it from hitting very hard so we can just let her fall I&#39;m kidding you were going to let me do it I wanted to see what we you were going to let do it it would have been cool why would you do that content h all right that&#39;s not so bad I&#39;m on oh my gosh it fits what was the TV back what&#39;s the size of this is that a 65 I think that&#39;s a 65 in behind it that was a 65 in TV it&#39;s gone sitting on a pretty normal height couch this belongs on r/ TV too high do you think we also maybe we&#39;re just like a little close to it sure sure still way too high I didn&#39;t really think about it in the theater because it has Theater seating in it in fact it has tiered Theater seating so you&#39;re really aiming for an optimal Middle Ground between the front and the rear row but if I was putting something like this in my living room I would only want it like 8 in above the floor like 20 cm above the floor right out of the gate Google TV is standard on all all of tcl&#39;s TVs at least here in North America mine doesn&#39;t which will make it really easy for Adam to turn off the gross motion smothing yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty bad right now you know every once in a while I&#39;ll go yeah maybe it&#39;s you know not that bad when I haven&#39;t looked at it in a while like I I&#39;ll say to myself maybe I wouldn&#39;t notice if I went into someone&#39;s house and they had motion smoothing on and then I get a new TV and I&#39;m like ew when I first was testing this even the boot logo had like motion artifacts and I was like w turn it off immediately it was so bad whoa is that a display hey you have a monitor I do several in fact I love the hoodie you&#39;re wearing today it&#39;s so appropriate it&#39;s huge it&#39;s not very bright it goes up to a Max of 500 nits we got 498 this ends up looking kind of flat overall though which I&#39;m surprised by because in the past the larger the display the greater the volume light it&#39;s throwing at you even if the peak brightness isn&#39;t as high and it can really help with immersion I still think it looks pretty okay for how giant of a TV this is and it&#39;s not OLED how much this cost you 1,500 bucks comparison is the thief of Joy if we had another TV right here I&#39;d be like oh yeah this thing sucks but like as is just walking into this room that&#39;s a big TV good it&#39;s a big TV and it&#39;s fun watching it I mean it sucks the Plex is loading right now but uh yeah I don&#39;t think it has the fastest Wi-Fi card but in the time since we bought that open box the New Gen one has come out so you can get a brand new one from TCL this size that&#39;s 2 Grand how much better is the brand new one is it brighter it seems to be pretty darn close but maybe better they say surprisingly little about anything but their Flagship TVs of course because TCL is not like a big Flagship brand like Sony is so what are they going to advertise well there&#39;s nothing wrong with buying TCL they don&#39;t know that I had TCL TV in my home for a long time they&#39;re the TV of the NFL hey like the colors look okay I don&#39;t tell I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re correct but like it&#39;s colorful enough they look pretty okay and I think the measurements had it at a Delta e of about 4 and a half what on average yeah just on in the movie mode uh Vivid mode gets awful and of course yeah yeah don&#39;t turn on Vivid mode if you care about the artist intense and everything no matter what trends a little blue sure sure it&#39;s wild how much like how far that&#39;s come in just the last four years if we were looking at this TV 5 years ago 3 years ago oh it would be over $10,000 and it would be terrible yeah now how many local dimming zones does it have did we count them does it have local dimming cuz this the contrast does not look great it looks like a boat in fact I don&#39;t know if it has local dimming zones is this just a VA panel with pretty okay contrast we counted one local dimming Zone the brightness is okay but a part of why it doesn&#39;t pop off the screen is that to appreciate the Peaks you got to have the valleys credit to their anti-glare though this is a very demanding environment for that with studio lights all over the place it&#39;s not bad I&#39;ve got like a pretty good string of lights in my field division at least right there but other than that it&#39;s fine and that&#39;s a pretty small like when you consider how big the TV is that&#39;s a pretty small portion of the TV if one of my friends bought this thing for5 $100 and I walked into their house and this is their TV i&#39; be like that&#39;s a sick TV one thing that is uh kind of disappointing but also understandable is the black uniformity yeah like you can see patches of whiteness brutal there&#39;s like a big triangle here yeah you&#39;re only really going to notice that though in those big panning shots yeah yeah when we got it dark enough to test it was very noticeable oh super noticeable there&#39;s a hot spot like right up the left side because you don&#39;t have local dimming you&#39;re relying on that diffusion layer to absolutely perfectly spread out the light from the backlight though two tcl&#39;s credit they didn&#39;t go EDG lit which ratings found recently does not really have any picture quality advantages but can lead to premature death so even though it doesn&#39;t have local dimming zones it is direct back lit which I would say is a good thing yeah I&#39;ve seen that too when one part of the light fails and then it&#39;s just dim like that one part of the monitor TV so I found a listing for an open boox S9 95b that&#39;s $1,600 that&#39;s a great deal so this is a generation old but QD OLED panel really nice TV it&#39;s too bad it looks like the child of that one yeah even with the not amazing ambient light rejection of QD OLED it&#39;s a lot better dude look look where you can see both of them I know but remember QD OLED has that kind of Purple Haze compared to Wed so this is even as good as this can look at M dude this Sun the color volume that&#39;s the thing is anything that has to do with full array local dimming is just going to it&#39;s going to lose the one that really stands out to me is the richness yeah of these tones here yeah this has no saturation this looks like I took some like cheesecloth and I put it all over the front of the screen I&#39;m looking through a veil and all the Shadows have actual depth to them mhm you don&#39;t lose anything in the image whereas with this it doesn&#39;t even get that dark it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not crushing blacks or anything cuz it&#39;s not even getting look at how much more realistic the sky looks that looks like blue looks real especially with the like leaves and stuff yeah but big big TV big TV okay but let&#39;s talk about gaming cuz you&#39;ve kind of left me waiting here I got to say this doesn&#39;t feel that bad no it looks like it&#39;s 120 HZ I don&#39;t even mean that I just mean the the latency yeah how do we set it to 144 though I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know actually I&#39;m I&#39;m not going to lie it&#39;s really confusing did they did they advertise it yeah they call it they call it game accelerator 240 I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just a backlight strobe oh what what do you mean 240 no I&#39;m talking about the 144 Herz yeah I don&#39;t know how they get that can you stop messing with it so what do you think where am I supposed to go up here what do you mean wow dude this level&#39;s scary scary you know what though this feels great try it sorry it&#39;s funny that&#39;s fine nice nice nice nice you got needled did was really nice up until when it wasn&#39;t nice yeah it feels totally fine feels completely responsive I could game whatever game you want to game on this TV and it would feel okay way better than LCDs that came out in the early 2000s felt awful I think overall I think it&#39;s totally fine yeah I I guess I&#39;m like who&#39;s it I guess it&#39;s for old people and bars frat house yeah actually if you walked into the frat house if they can spring for 1,500 bucks for frat house is still a bit much you and 15 of your friends pitching a hundred bucks right you bring this bad boy in play Smash on it eight player smash yeah no problem at all I have no idea what the long-term quality of it is going to be like obviously this is like not by any means a bad TV no no and like I can I would recommend it to somebody if they were in the market for a really big TV and had a very low budget um that was their goal yes yeah big TV cheap it&#39;s mindboggling and we&#39;ll link to it in the description and everything like that uh as well as some other good TVs that you can check out if you don&#39;t have the space for 98 in whoa okay I just found something that&#39;s cheaper than this what and bigger cheaper and bigger that&#39;s right that&#39;s
