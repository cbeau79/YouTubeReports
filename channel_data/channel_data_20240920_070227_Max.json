(LAUGHS) (GUNSHOTS) (LAUGHS) MATT REEVES:<i> When Lauren came in\n and she pitched</i> what she wanted to do\nin the first episode, the Alberto thing was\none of the first things -that she pitched.\n-(GUNSHOTS) Dylan and I were just like,\n&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot; (GUNSHOT) <i> That was a really,\n really brilliant stroke.</i> LAUREN LEFRANC:<i> We wanted to get\n into Oz&#39;s psychology.</i> We&#39;re planting seeds\nthat there&#39;s something <i>a little bit more disturbing\n there.</i> <i> It was really important\n to make sure</i> that you understood Oz\nand the man he further becomes because of who he is inside. He tells this story\nabout Rex Calabrese. <i> Alberto looks at that\n and does the one thing</i> <i>you should never do with Oz.</i> (ALBERTO LAUGHS) CRAIG ZOBEL:<i> He laughs at him.</i> COLIN FARRELL:<i> They probably\n do share a similarity,</i> <i> Alberto and Oz,</i> in that neither of them\nhave been taken very seriously. <i> Alberto doesn&#39;t see\nwhat might be encroaching</i> <i>from any particular side,\nwhich is a great weakness</i> when you&#39;re living\nin the kind of worlds that Alberto\nwould be inhabiting.  MATT:<i> Alberto steps\n on that third rail,</i> and when he&#39;s mocked\nfor that, <i> that&#39;s where you see\n the deep rage</i> <i> and impulsiveness of Oz.</i> (GUNSHOT) Oz is basically recovering\nfrom what he&#39;s done to Alberto really for\nthe rest of the series. CRAIG:<i> This being\nthe first scene of the show,</i> <i> it was important to us\nin the fact that it showed Oz</i> doing something rash\nthat he quickly regrets. <i>And it kind of launches him\n into the story</i> <i> that we&#39;re gonna watch\n in the series.</i> (LOUD THUD) -Hey!\n-(YELPS) (GUNSHOT) I-- I&#39;m sorry,\nI&#39;m sor-- (GRUNTS) OZ COBB:\nTrying to steal my shit? Please, please, please. CRAIG:<i> It wouldn&#39;t have been\n that much of a thing</i> to just kill this kid, <i> but Oz has a disability,</i> <i>and he sees this disability\n in Vic.</i> RHENZY FELIZ:<i> I think\nhe hears it in the stutter,</i> <i> and Oz, with his leg,\n understands that...</i> Victor maybe hasn&#39;t been given\na bunch of chances in life. Now you wanted my car so badly,\nyou can drive it. LAUREN:<i>\nOz is a very peculiar character,</i> <i> and Victor is our entree\n into who Oz is.</i> Aqua paradise. -VICTOR AGUILAR: It&#39;s nice.\n-Yeah, it&#39;s nice. LAUREN:<i> He really likes\n those air fresheners,</i> and yet, he also murdered\nthe Falcone boss <i>in the first five minutes\n of the show.</i> And you can&#39;t quite\nput your finger on who this man is,\nand that&#39;s the point. -That&#39;s the fun of it.\n-(LAUGHS) MATT:<i> In that night,</i> which would feel like\nthis kind of pressure cooker, <i> there would be a turn.</i> <i>The seed has been planted.</i> <i> Maybe Vic is not dead.</i> W-- Whatever you need,\nwhatever it is. Jesus, I need a chance. His relationship with Oz\nevolves, and that&#39;s really more\nwhere you start to see <i> who Victor is</i> <i>and how he kind of interacts\n with the world.</i> There you go. We have a relationship\nbuilt on status. I got ambition. Teacher/student,\nyou know, master/mentor. Well, maybe it&#39;ll be useful\nkeepin&#39; you around. That&#39;s where the relationship\nreally starts, <i> is, &quot;Give me a shot.&quot;</i> -\u266a (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) \u266a\n-(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) MILOS GRAPA: Sofia, join us. SOFIA FALCONE:\nOh, I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt. MATT:<i> When Cristin shows up\n in the first episode,</i> <i> you feel that,\n&quot;Wait, wait, what&#39;s this?&quot;</i> She&#39;s just completely\nupended everything. Oz is kind of barely\nholding all this together. It feels like he&#39;s going\nto get away with it. And then suddenly, <i>there&#39;s a force of nature\n that enters,</i> <i> and that is Sofia.</i> Sofia would show up\nbasically over his shoulder. <i> We wanted to make sure\nthat she had the power there.</i> They have so much history\nbetween them, and they both know the score. Sofia, I thought you were\nstill at, uh... -Arkham?\n-Yeah. No. I&#39;ve been rehabilitated. CRISTIN MILIOTI:<i> She comes out\n like a real taut wire,</i> just a fuse ready to explode, but has to really,\nlike, keep a lid on it. COLIN:<i> Sofia&#39;s presence\n is more dangerous</i> <i> than it may have been if</i> <i> Alberto and Oz\ndidn&#39;t play out the way it does.</i> <i> She is a threat.</i> She&#39;s a potential obstacle\nbetween Oz and him realizing what he wants to realize\nin this world. DYLAN CLARK:<i>\n In the comic book lore,</i> <i> you don&#39;t want to start\n with Oz as the kingpin.</i> <i> You want to see\nhow he becomes the kingpin.</i> Sofia also wanting and having\nthe same ambitions. <i> How does she become\n a counterpoint</i> <i>and a real opposition to Oz?</i> Are you nervous, Oz? Nervous? I&#39;d hate for you\nto feel nervous with me. CRAIG:<i> Oz really is a character\nthat gets backed into situations</i> <i> and does his best work</i> in figuring out\nhow to save himself. SOFIA:<i> People underestimate you,\n but not me.</i> I&#39;ve always known\nyou were capable of more. CRAIG:<i> By the time that he goes\n to visit his mom,</i> <i>and has really, at that point,\n decided to run away,</i> <i>she talks him out of that\n and says, like,</i> &quot;No, you should-- you should\nuse this to gain power.&quot; DEIRDRE O&#39;CONNELL:<i>\nShe&#39;s ferociously involved.</i> It&#39;s almost like she wants\nto give him her blood, and her blood\nis very ferocious, and her blood\nis very fearless. LAUREN:<i> When she sees\n any weakness in her son,</i> <i> she can barely stand it.</i> Do you hear the words\ncoming out of your mouth? -OZ: Yeah.\n-How weak they sound? It&#39;s just the two of them. <i> So they have\nthis strange little pact.</i> FRANCIS COBB:\nWhat you did wasn&#39;t impulsive. It was instinctual. LAUREN:<i>\nEven though he would want\nto be revered and respected,</i> he just needs his mom\nto say she loves him. This city is meant\nto be yours, sweetheart. What are you gonna do\nto get it? CRAIG:<i> He then designs\n a long-shot way</i> <i> to see if he can\n navigate through</i> all of these very dangerous\nkind of scenarios <i> that he&#39;s gonna have to\n navigate through.</i> LAUREN:<i> You start to understand\n how Oz dodges and weaves</i> and gets through things,\nand he barely scrapes by <i> by the end of 101.</i> And it felt very emblematic\nof Oz as a character. \u266a (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS) \u266a"
