      "subtitles": "[Music] this is Orion meta&#39;s first pair of AR glasses up top I want to be clear Orion was supposed to be a product you could buy but it&#39;s not instead it&#39;s a Peak at what meta has coming for Hardware it&#39;s releasing over the next few years and in a bigger way it&#39;s a marker of where the smart glasses of today are eventually headed I was one of the first people outside of meta to try ran for about 2 hours I Ed the glasses to browse the web play games and video call with people through Messenger oh and Mark Zuckerberg beat me in pong this is going to be the whole interview it&#39;s just an hour of us we can&#39;t it&#39;s like we were going to ask questions but instead I just you say you&#39;re undefeated no no no okay absolutely not i&#39; never won a game before this week okay oh okay i&#39; had only been defeated good game good game you you have un Fair Advantage but that&#39;s all right I a few more Aion exists in three parts the glasses themselves a neural wristband for controlling them with finger movements and a wireless compute Puck that offloads app logic from the glasses to help improve battery and reduce heat the way you navigate the interface is through eye and hand tracking voice and most importantly the neural wristband it&#39;s hard to compare this experience to a laptop or phone but in the simplest of terms ter your eyes or hands act as the mouse and you click by pinching your fingers together if you&#39;ve ever used the Vision Pro you&#39;ll get how the eye tracking works pretty quickly I want to focus on the wristband for a second because it&#39;s truly one of the most magical experiences I&#39;ve had with a piece of new technology and I think the world will be seeing it in the wild even before the commercial successor to Orion is released it&#39;s about the size of a Fitbit and uses electromyography to interpret neural signals and translate them into the input for the glasses the main gestures it recognizes are pinching your index finger with your thumb to select pinching your middle finger and thumb to invoke the main menu and swiping up or down with your thumb against your closed Palm to scroll there&#39;s haptic feedback on the band to let you know when it recognizes a gesture which is a helpful signal that made me quickly comfortable with using it do you like using hand tracking at all with this or do you mostly just do the band it depends on what the app is I mean for some of the things I think it is still pretty natural to like Reach Out And Touch It and all that but but I don&#39;t know I mean the band is just going to keep getting better and better right now you have to do these these little subtle gestures but I mean the plan is over the next few years to make it set and just pick up almost motionless gestures that you that you make so I think that&#39;ll be pretty wild once you get there the first thing you notice when you put Orion on is it&#39;s 70\u00b0 field of view which is much wider than any pair of Air glasses I&#39;ve tried to date a narrow field of view means that a graphics don&#39;t feel much of what you&#39;re seeing but with Orion I had to get up pretty close to something before its edges started to disappear this made a huge difference for the overall experience U LED projectors inside the frame of Orion beam Graphics in front of your vision via wave guides in the lenses which are made of silicon carbide and not glass seven cameras and sensors in the frames sense the world around you to Anchor virtual objects in space you can leave a window open turn your head and walk away come back and it&#39;s still there the quality of the graphics isn&#39;t at the level that I&#39;d want to watch a movie in the glasses but I had no problem reading text on a web page that was several feet away my demo consisted of experiences designed to simulate how one may use AR glasses throughout the day in the future it&#39;s clear meta has an idea for how people will use glasses like these but the software is early My Demo was very much on Rails and guided by meta employees in the room though I was able to navigate the glasses on my own a little bit and jump in and out of apps the coolest part of the demo was using meta AI to identify ingredients for a smoothie that we&#39;re out on a table and then have the glasses show me a recipe to make them with instructions it was a Peak at how generative AI can intersect with a form factor like this in pretty powerful ways did you guys know that I make smoothies like every morning like this is kind of getting creepy good to see man yeah give me a smoothie recipe sure let me take a look at what ingredients you already have then I can put a recipe together for you I found several ingredients let me make a recipe that&#39;s all right it missed the pineapple but that&#39;s okay you don&#39;t really want that deep down okay here we gotch ban matcha banana boost incorporates most of your ingredients I would do that I&#39;ve never done Macha in smothie we also chatted with our editor-in chief Nei Patel can you see me at all what do you see I see nothing I see a gray gray screen that&#39;s what Alex looks like on the I see you but I&#39;ve got Verge pulled up on a pain here and then you&#39;re just like a video hanging out in the middle do you see like a whole Square am I just like floating is just my head yeah you&#39;re floating it&#39;s like a square window you&#39;re floating and I can like come up to you what&#39;s the resolution like I just came off the vergecast I got like a very French headphone hair going on here can you see that look good um it&#39;s about good it&#39;s something good I mean it&#39;s like it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to like watch Avatar but it&#39;s like it&#39;s good like I can see well you sound great I have to say I can&#39;t tell if that is the microphone on the glasses or the speakers on the iPhone but you sound great it&#39;s the glasses yeah it&#39;s weird that I can&#39;t see you are they going to add avatars to this thing yeah so they the glasses have inward facing cameras so they will scan my face and represent me as a codc avatar when I&#39;m calling you and they&#39;re not but they&#39;re not selling this thing yeah they&#39;re not they didn&#39;t make many they cost a lot of money so like yeah amazing well tell them to send me one yeah yeah Nei wants one [Music] Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about air glasses for a long long time he&#39;s called them the Holy Grail device that will eventually replace smartphones and Orion is the first pair of Air glasses I&#39;ve tried that made me feel like that future isn&#39;t so far away that it feels like a pipe dream but there was a moment in my demo that showed me just how much work meta still has to do to get this right at one point I had multiple windows open to to the side while sitting across from someone at a table and an incoming video call then pushed one of the windows directly over the person I was sitting across and at that point it felt like the glasses weren&#39;t augmenting reality but breaking [Music] it Orion was going to be a product meta sold to the world until a couple of years ago when it realized it couldn&#39;t manufacture them in a way that would even make sense at an ultra high-end price point so instead it&#39;s made about a thousand of for internal prototyping and demos like the one I received so why is meta showing Orion to the world if you can&#39;t buy a pair it&#39;s impressive even for a prototype and it&#39;s not an exaggeration to say these glasses are the instate of Zuckerberg&#39;s big bet on the metaverse after all these years and the billions of dollars poured into making them I think the company wants to have something to show off even if air glasses still aren&#39;t quite ready for prime time I do like the visual of this looking like myores it&#39;s like yeah well this is like one of the oldest video games ever right so I guess it&#39;s appropriate we&#39;re doing it on here but we got some more dimensionals"

      "subtitles": "[Music] Mark we just tried Orion together yeah we&#39;re fresh off of it it feels like true AR glasses are finally getting closer Orion is a product that you all have been working on for five plus years yeah almost 10 almost 10 yeah so take me back to the beginning when you started the project when it started in research like what were you thinking about what was the goal for it well I I think a lot of it goes all the way back to our relationship with mobile platforms and all that right so it&#39;s um you know we have lived through one major platform transition already because we started on web right not not on mobile and mobile phones and smartphones kind of got started around the same time as Facebook and and kind of early social media was getting started so didn&#39;t really get to play any role in that platform transition but going through it right we weren&#39;t born on mobile we kind of had this awareness that okay web was a thing mobile is a thing it is different um there are strengths and weaknesses of it there&#39;s this Continuum of computing where now you have a a mobile device that you can take with you all the time and that&#39;s amazing MH but it&#39;s small kind of pulls you away from other interactions those things are not great but there was sort of this recognition that just like there&#39;s the transition from computers to mobile um mobile is not going to be the end of the line so as soon as we started becoming like a more I I guess I&#39;d say Stable Company like once we found our footing on mobile and and we weren&#39;t like clearly going to go out of business or something like that I was like okay let&#39;s start um planting our our some seeds for what we think could be the future right it&#39;s like mobile is already kind of getting defined um you know by 2012 2014 is it was generally too late to to Really shape that platform in a meaningful way I we we had some experiments I didn&#39;t succeed or go anywhere so pretty quickly I was like okay we should focus on the future because just like there&#39;s the shift from from from desktop to Mobile new things are going to be possible in the future so what is that um I think the kind of simplest version of it is basically what you started seeing with Orion right it&#39;s it&#39;s like the vision is a normal pair of glasses that can do two really fundamental things one is put Holograms in the world to deliver this realistic sense of presence like you there with another person or in another place or maybe you&#39;re physically with a person but just like we did you can pull up a virtual pong game or you know whatever um you can work on things together you can sit at a coffee shop pull up your whole uh workstation of different monitors you know you can be on a flight or in the backseat of a car and pull up a full screen movie theater and and like okay all these things like great Computing full sense of presence like you&#39;re there with people no matter where they are thing two is it&#39;s the ideal device for AI and the reason for that is because glasses are sort of uniquely positioned for you to be able to let them see what you see and hear what you hear and give you very subtle feedback back to you where they can speak in your ear or um or they can have silent input that that kind of shows up on the on the glasses that that other people can&#39;t see and doesn&#39;t take you away from the world around you and I think that that is all going to be really profound now when we got started with this I had thought that kind of the Hologram part of this was going to be possible before AI um so it&#39;s sort of an interesting Twist of faith that the AI part is actually possible before um before the Holograms are really able to be mass-produced at a at kind of an affordable price but um but that was sort of the vision I think that it&#39;s pretty easy to wrap your head around and there&#39;s already you know billion to two billion people who wear glasses on a daily basis just like you know everyone who didn&#39;t have smartphones were kind of the first people to upgrade two smartphones I think everyone who has glasses is pretty quickly going to upgrade to smart glasses over the next decade and then I think it&#39;s going to start being really valuable and you know a lot of other people who aren&#39;t wearing glasses today are going to end up wearing them too um that&#39;s kind of the simple version and then I think as we&#39;ve developed this out there are all these sort of more Nu directions that have emerged too so we&#39;ve started you know while while that was kind of the full version of what we wanted to build there are all these things that we said okay well well maybe it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to build normal looking glasses that can do Holograms um at an affordable price point so what parts of that can we take on and that&#39;s where we did the partnership with slor luoda so it&#39;s like okay before you have a display you can get normal looking glasses that can have a camera they can have a microphone great audio can capture content can um um and you can stream video at this point but the most important feature at this point is the ability to access meta Ai and just kind of have kind of a full AI there multimodal because it has has camera um and I mean that product is starting at $300 and you know initially I kind of thought hey this is sort of on the technology path to building full holographic glasses at this point I actually just think both are going to exist longterm right I think that there are going to be people who want the full holographic glasses and I think that there are going to be people who prefer kind of the superior form factor or lower price of a device where they are primarily optimizing for getting AI um I also think there&#39;s going to be a range of things in between right so there&#39;s the full kind of field of view that we that you just saw right 70\u00b0 really wide field of view for glasses um but I think that there are other products in between that too there&#39;s like a heads up display version which um you know for that you probably just need you know 20 30\u00b0 you can&#39;t do kind of the full kind of world Holograms where you&#39;re interacting with things like you&#39;re not going to play ping pong in in 30 Dee field of view um but you can communicate with AI um you can text your friends you can get directions um you can see the content that you&#39;re capturing um so I there&#39;s a lot there that&#39;s going to be compelling and at each step along this Continuum from display list to small display to kind of full holographic you&#39;re packing more technology in so each step up is going to be a little more expensive um is going to have a little more constraints on the form factor even though I think we&#39;ll get them all to be attractive you&#39;ll be able to do the the kind of simpler ones and much smaller form factors permanently um and then of course there&#39;s the mixed reality headsets which kind of took a different direction which is going towards the same vision but on that we said okay well we&#39;re not going to try to fit into a glasses form factor for that one we&#39;re going to say okay we&#39;re going to really go for all the compute that we want and we&#39;re going to say okay this is going to be more of like a heads goggles form factor and my guess is that that&#39;s going to be a thing long term too because there are a bunch of uses where people want the full immersion um and you know if you&#39;re sitting at your desk and working for a long period of time you might want the more computing power than you&#39;re going to be able to get but but I I I think that there&#39;s no doubt that kind of what you saw with Orion is the I think kind of quintessential vision of what people what at least kind of I thought and and continue to think is going to be the next multi billion person major Computing platform and then kind of all these other things are going to get built out around it it&#39;s my understanding that you originally hoped Orion would be a consumer product when you first set out to build it yeah yeah Orion was meant to be our first consumer product and we weren&#39;t sure if we were going to be able to pull it off I mean in general it&#39;s probably turned out significantly better than our kind of 50/50 estimates of what it would be but we didn&#39;t get there on everything that we wanted to I think we we still wanted to be a little smaller um a little brighter like a little bit higher resolution um and a lot more affordable before we kind of put it out there as a product and and look we have line of sight to all those things so I think um so so I I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll probably have the thing that was going to be the V2 end up being the consumer product and we&#39;re going to use Orion with developers to basically cultivate the software experience that way by the time we&#39;re ready to ship something it&#39;s going to be much more dialed in but to be clear you&#39;re not selling Orion at all I guess what I&#39;m wondering is when you made the call I think it was around 2022 to say oryan is going to just be internal kind of dev kit um how did you feel about making that call was there any part of you that was like man I really wish this could have just been the consumer product we had built I me I always want to ship stuff quickly and and all that um but I think it was the right thing I mean I think on this product I think that there is a there&#39;s a pretty clear set of constraints that I think you want to hit MH um especially around the form Factor right I mean it it is very helpful for us that sort of chunkier glasses are kind of ascendant in the fashion world because that allows us to build glasses that are going to be fashionable but also Tech forward but um even so I&#39;d say you know these are unmistakably glasses they&#39;re reasonably comfortable they&#39;re you know under 100 gram I them for two hours and I couldn&#39;t really tell yeah but but I mean I think we aspire to building things that like look really good right and and I think this is like good glasses but I I I wanted it to be a little a little smaller so it can fit within like really fashionable right when people see the ray bands there&#39;s no compromise on fashion it&#39;s like like part of why I think people like them is yeah you get all this functionality but even when you&#39;re not using it they&#39;re great glasses and I I think for the future version of Orion that&#39;s the Target too we want to make it so that um you know most of the time you&#39;re going through your day you&#39;re not Computing right and or it&#39;s or something is happening in the background or something but um so it just needs to be good in order for you to kind of want to keep it on your face and I I feel like we&#39;re almost there I think we made we&#39;ve made more progress than anyone else in the world that I&#39;m aware of um but it didn&#39;t quite hit my bar um and similarly on price um these are going to be more expensive than the ray bands right I mean there&#39;s just a lot more Tech that&#39;s going in them but you know we do want to have it be within a consumer price point and um this was this was outside that race so I wanted to wait until we could get to that range in order to to have something that we sh are you imagining that the first commercial version whenever it is in the next couple few years will it be a developer focused product that you&#39;re selling publicly you want it to be a consumer ready and that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking about the strategy because Apple snap others have decided to do developer Focus plays and get the hardware kind of going with developers early but you&#39;re kind of are you saying you&#39;re skipping that and you just want cons we are using this as a developer kit just primarily inter and maybe with a handful of Partners but I mean I think at this point meta is by far the kind of Premier developer of augmented reality and virtual and mixed reality software and Hardware in the world so you can think about it as a developer kit but we just have a lot of that talent inous and then we also have well-developed Partnerships with a lot of folks externally who we can go to and work with them as well so it&#39;s um I don&#39;t think we need to go announce a dev kit that like that kind of arbitrary developers can go buy to get access to the talent that we need to go build out the platform I think we&#39;re kind of in a place where we can work with partners and and do that but that&#39;s absolutely what we&#39;re going to do over the next few years we&#39;re going to hone the experience and figure out what we need to do to to to Really nail it when it&#39;s ready to ship a lot has been written about how much you&#39;re spending on reality labs and if you I don&#39;t you probably can&#39;t have an exact number but if you were to guesstimate the cost of just building Orion over the last 10 years are we talking five plus billion more than that um yeah probably probably yeah yeah but I mean overall um for reality labs for a while a lot of people thought of all of that budget is going towards virtual and mixed reality and I actually think we&#39;ve said publicly that our glasses programs are are a bigger budget than our virtual and mixed reality programs um but that goes across all of them right so that&#39;s the kind of full AR that&#39;s um the displaylist glasses like all the work we&#39;re going to do on on um on rayan and we just announced the expanded partnership with luoda luoda great company we&#39;ve had a great experience working with them they designed so many great glasses and I think you know working with them to to do even more um is is is going to be really exciting so there there&#39;s a lot more to do there on on all of these things how does this partnership work uh and this renew that you just did with them how is it structured what is this deal like you know I think it was more of just a kind of commitment from companies that we&#39;re feeling pretty good about how this is going and we&#39;re going to build a lot more glasses together and part of the way it works is um you know rather than having sort of doing one generation and then designing the Next Generation I think by having a longer term partnership it allows the teams to not just have to worry about one thing at a time then like okay is this one going to be good and then how do we build on that for the next one now we can start like a multi-year road map of many different devices knowing that we&#39;re going to be working together for a long time so I&#39;m optimistic about that that&#39;s sort of how we work internally right we don&#39;t just I mean sometimes when you&#39;re early on you you definitely want to learn from each device launch but um when there are things that you&#39;re committed to I don&#39;t think you want the team to feel like okay if we don&#39;t get the short-term Milestone then like we&#39;re going to cancel the whole thing right um so are you buying mistake in elsur lexotica um yeah I think we&#39;ve talked about investing in them it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to be a a kind of major thing I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of a of a symbolic um thing I me we we we want to have this to be a long-term partnership and um as as part of that um I thought that this would be kind of a nice gesture and I fundamentally believe in them a lot I mean I think that they&#39;re going to go from being a the premier glasses company in the world to I think one of the major technology companies in the world I me my vision for for them and how I think about it is that if you think about like how Samsung in in Korea kind of um made it so that Samsung that Korea became one of the main hubs of building phones in the world I mean I think that this is probably kind of one of the best shots for Europe and Italy in particular to become a major hub for manufacturing and building and designing the next major category of of smart glasses and sorry of computing platforms overall so um and and I think that they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of all in on that now and and it&#39;s been this interesting question um because you know they have they have such a good business and such deep competence in in the areas and I I&#39;ve gotten more of an appreciation of how strong of a technology they company they are in their own way right designing lenses designing the materials that you need to make um fashionable glasses that can be light enough but um but also kind of like feel good um they have they bring a huge amount that I think is um people in kind of our world the tech World probably don&#39;t necessarily see but but I think that they&#39;re really well set up for the future so I I I believe in the partnership I&#39;m really excited about the work that we&#39;re doing together and fundamentally I think that that&#39;s just going to be a massively successful company in the future um is is it set up to where they control the designs or and you provide the tech stack or do you collaborate on the design like I I think we collaborate on on everything it&#39;s it&#39;s actually I mean part of working together is um you kind of build a joint culture over time and there were a lot of really sharp people over there who I think it took maybe a couple versions for us really to gain an appreciation for how we each of us approach things because um you know they really think about things from this like fashion manufacturing lens selling optical devices perspective um and we obviously come at it from uh kind of consumer electronics AI umof software perspective but I think over time we just kind of appreciate each other&#39;s perspectives on things a lot more and I mean I I&#39;m like constantly talking to them about things to get their ideas on different things I mean but you know when Partnerships are working well when you reach out to them to get their opinion on things that are not actually currently in the scope of what you&#39;re working on together and and because I I do that frequently with um with Rocco who runs their wearables and Franchesco who&#39;s their their uh their CEO it&#39;s um and our team does that too with with like a large part of the working group over there it&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s a good crew they&#39;re they they kind of they share good values they&#39;re they&#39;re really sharp and like I said I I believe in them a lot and I think it&#39;s going to be a very successful partnership and Company yeah how many Rayband metas have you sold so far I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve given a number on that but I know it&#39;s asking yeah it&#39;s um it&#39;s going very well uh you know one of the things I think is interesting is we we underestimated demand so part of you know one thing that is very different in the world of consumer electronics than software is um there are fewer kind of Supply constraints in software there are some I mean like some of the stuff that we&#39;re rolling out like voice on meta AI um we need to meter it as we&#39;re rolling it out because we need to make sure we have enough inference capacity to to handle it but fundamentally we&#39;ll resolve that um in weeks right but for manufacturing it&#39;s like you make these concrete decisions like okay are we setting up four manufacturing lines or six and you know each one it was a big upfront capex investment and you&#39;re basically deciding upfront the velocity at which you&#39;re going to be able to generate Supply before you know what the demand is so on this one we thought that Rayband meta was probably going to sell three or five times more than the first version did and we just dramatically underestimated what the so now we&#39;re in this position where it&#39;s actually been somewhat hard for us to gauge what the real demand is because they&#39;re sold out you can&#39;t get them so if you can&#39;t get them like then then how do you know where where the actual curve is but but that&#39;s um we&#39;re basically getting to the point where that&#39;s resolved now we we kind of adjusted we made the decision to build more more manufacturing lines they took some time to do it they&#39;re online now we&#39;re kind of you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not just about being able to make them you need to get them into all the stores and get the distribution right we feel like that&#39;s in a pretty good place now so I&#39;d say over the rest of this year we&#39;re going to start getting a real sense of the demand but while that&#39;s going on the glasses keep getting better because of overthe a AI updates so the hardware doesn&#39;t necessarily change even though um we keep shipping new frames and new type of you know they&#39;re adding more Transitions lenses because people want to wear them indoors um and that&#39;s an interesting thing because I mean people sunglasses are a little more discretionary so I think a lot more people early on were thinking hey yeah I&#39;ll try I&#39;ll experiment with this with sunglasses I&#39;m not going to make these my primary glasses um now we&#39;re seeing a lot more people say hey this actually really useful I want to be able to wear them inside I want them to be my primary glasses so whether that&#39;s kind of working with them through the optical Channel or the transitions that&#39;s an important part but the the AI part of this um is also it just keeps getting better I we talked about it at um at connect I mean basically the ability to now you over the next few months when we roll This Out real-time translations you&#39;re traveling abroad someone&#39;s speaking Spanish to you you just get it translated into English in your ear just roll out to more and more languages over time I think we&#39;re starting with a few we&#39;ll kind of hit more over time um I tried that well actually I didn&#39;t try real time but I tried looking at a menu in French and it translated into English and then I was like at the end I was like what is Euro and dollar actually and it did that too and then I&#39;m also starting to see the Continuum of this to Orion in the sense of the utility aspects you could say look at this and remind me about it at 8:00 p.m. tonight and then it sinks with so I guess it&#39;s not replacing the phone but it&#39;s augmenting what I would do with my phone like how are these glasses going to be more deeply tied to Med AI over time um seems like they&#39;re getting closer and closer all the time but yeah well well I think Medi is becoming a more and more prominent feature of the glasses right there&#39;s more stuff that you can do so you just mentioned reminders as another example it&#39;s like now that is just going to work and now your glasses can remind you of things and so okay you can look at a phone number and say call this phone number and then it calls on the phone you know just will just add more capabilities over time and some of better are model updates right so like okay now it has llama 3.2 but um but some of it is is kind of software development around it like reminders you don&#39;t get for free just because we updated the model that&#39;s kind we have this big software development effort and um and and we&#39;re kind of adding features continuously and developing the ecosystem right so you get more apps so know Spotify and all these different things kind of kind of can work more natively so the glasses just more and more useful um which I think is also going to increase demand over time and how does it interact with phones I mean like you said I don&#39;t think people are getting rid of phones anytime soon um the way I kind of think about this is that when phones became the primary Computing platform we didn&#39;t get rid of computers we just kind of shifted right so I I I don&#39;t know if you have this experience but at some point in the early 2010s I noticed that I&#39;d be sitting at my desk in front of my computer and I&#39;d just pull out my phone to do things yeah and I think what&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to throw away our phones but I think slowly um we&#39;re just going to start doing more things with our glasses and leaving our phones in our pockets more and it&#39;s not like we&#39;re done with our computers and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be done with our phones for a while but there&#39;s a pretty clear path where um where you&#39;re just going to use your glasses for more and more things and over time I the glasses are also going to be able to be powered by wrist-based wearables or other wearables so you&#39;re going to wake up one day 10 years AG from now and you&#39;re not even going to need to bring your phone with you now you&#39;re still going to have a phone but I I think like more of the time people are going to leave it in their pocket or leave it in their bag or eventually even some of the time leave it in their at home and um I think there will just be this sort of gradual shift to glasses becoming the main way that we do Computing it&#39;s interesting that we&#39;re talking about this right now because I feel like phones are becoming kind of boring and stale you know like I I just was like looking at the new iPhone and it&#39;s basically the same as the year before people are doing foldables but like it feels like people have kind of run out of ideas on phones and that they&#39;re kind of at their natural end State and I wonder you know when you see something like the rayb bands and how people have really gravitated to them in a way that&#39;s surprised you guys and I think surprised all of us but it&#39;s also just like people want to interact with technology in different ways now and I think AI like you said at the beginning like the way that AI is intersected with this is just kind of like a aha thing for people that honestly for me I didn&#39;t expect it to click as quickly as it did but like when I got WID listed for the AI I was like walking around my backyard and like using it and I was like oh like I it&#39;s obvious now where this is going so it feels like we&#39;re like I was saying at the beginning it feels like things are finally you can see where it&#39;s going whereas Before It&#39;s been a lot of like R&amp;D and talking about it but like these the ray bands are kind of a signifier of that and I&#39;m wondering if you agree with that I agree I mean I still think it&#39;s early um I think you really want to be able to not just ask the AI questions but ask it to do things yeah and know that it&#39;s going to reliably go do it and we&#39;re starting with simple things right so voice control of your glasses although you can do that on phones too things like ERS although you can generally do that on on phones too but I think as the model capabilities grow over the next couple of generations and you get more of you know what people call these agentic um capabilities I think it&#39;s it&#39;s going to start to get pretty exciting for what it&#39;s worth I I I also think that all the AI work is going to make phones a lot more exciting um it&#39;s the most exciting thing I think that has happened to our family of apps road map in a long time is all of the all the AI things that we&#39;re building so um you know if I were trying to design what you know the next few versions of iPhone or Google&#39;s phone should be I mean I I think that there&#39;s a long and interesting road map of things that they can go do with AI that um as an app developer we can&#39;t so um so I think that that&#39;s like a pretty exciting and and interesting thing for them to go do which I I assume that they will on the AI uh social media piece one of the Wilder things that your team told me you guys are going to start doing is showing people AI generated imagery personalized to them in feed I think it&#39;s starting as an experiment but like if you&#39;re a photographer you would see Meta AI generating content that&#39;s maybe personalized for you alongside content from the people you follow yeah and that&#39;s this idea that I&#39;ve been thinking about of AI and kind of invading social media so to speak um maybe you don&#39;t like the word invading but you know what I mean and what does that what does that do to how we how we relate to each other as humans like how much AI stuff and AI Genera stuff is going to be filling feeds in the near future uh in your view well here&#39;s how I Comm at this so in the history of running the company where we&#39;ve been building these apps for 20 years every call it 3 to five years there&#39;s some new major format that comes along that is typically additive to the experience right so you know initially people kind of updated their profiles then they were able to post statuses that were texts then then links um you got photos early on um then you added videos um then with mobile basically you know snap invented stories the first version of that and that became a a pretty kind of widely used format um the whole version of short form videos I think is is sort of a still ascendant format but you basically um at each step along the way you want to right it&#39;s like you keep on making the system richer by having more different types of content that people can um can share and and different ways to express themselves and when you look out for the next 10 years of okay if this trend seems to happen where every 3 five years whatever the pace is that there are new formats I think given the pace of change in the tech industry I think you&#39;d bet that that continues or accelerates and I think you&#39;d bet that probably most of the new formats are going to be kind of AI connected in some way given that that&#39;s the kind of driving theme for the industry at this point so given that kind of set of assumptions um we&#39;re sort of trying to understand what are the things that are most useful to people within that um there&#39;s one vein of this which is helping people and creators make better content using AI right so that&#39;s um that I think is going to be pretty clear right just make it like super easy for like aspiring creators or Advanced creators to make much better stuff than they would be able to otherwise um that can take the format of like all right like my daughter is writing a book and she wants it Illustrated and like we sit down together and work with meta Ai and imagine to help her come up with images to illustrate it um it&#39;s like okay that&#39;s like a thing that&#39;s like she didn&#39;t have the capability to do that before she&#39;s not a graphic designer but now she kind of has that that that that ability I think that that&#39;s going to be pretty cool um then I think that there&#39;s a version where you have just this great diversity of AI agents that are as part of the system and this I think is a big difference between our vision of AI and most of the other companies is yeah we&#39;re building meta AI as as kind of the main assistant that you can build that&#39;s sort of equivalent to you know the singular assistant that maybe like a Google or an open AI or different folks are building but it&#39;s not really the main thing that we&#39;re doing um you know our main vision is that we think that there are going to be a lot of these right it&#39;s every business all the hundreds of millions of small businesses um you know just like they have a website and an email address and a social media account today I think that they&#39;re all going to have an AI that helps them interact with their customers in the future that does some combination of sales and customer support and all that um I think all the creators are basically going to want some version of this that basically helps them interact with their Community when they&#39;re just limited by they don&#39;t have enough hours in the day to interact with all the messages that are coming in and um they want to make sure that they can show some love to to people in their in their Community um and those I think are just the two most obvious ones that even if we just did those that&#39;s many hundreds of millions but then there&#39;s going to be all this more creative stuff that&#39;s ugc that people create for that are kind of Wilder use cases that they want and our view is okay these are all going to like live across these social networks and Beyond and um I I don&#39;t think that they should just be constrained to waiting until someone messages them right I think that they&#39;re going to have their own profiles they&#39;re going to be creating content people will be able to follow them if they want um you&#39;ll be able to comment on their stuff um they may be able to comment on your stuff if you&#39;re connected with them I there will obviously be different different logic and rules but that that&#39;s one way that there&#39;s going to be just a lot more kind of AI participants in the kind of broader social construct that we have and then I think you get to the test that you mentioned which is maybe the most abstract which is just having kind of the central meta AI system directly generate content for you based on what we think is going to be interesting to you and putting that in your feed and on that you know I think that there&#39;s this been there&#39;s been this trend over time where the feeds started off as primarily and exclusively content from people you you followed friends um I guess it was friends early on then it kind of broadened out to okay you followed a set of friends and creators and then it got to a point where the algorithm was good enough where we&#39;re actually showing you a lot of stuff that you&#39;re not following directly because um in some ways that&#39;s a better way to show you more interesting stuff than only constraining it to things that you&#39;ve chosen to follow and I think the next logical jump on that is like okay we&#39;re showing you content from your friends and creators that you&#39;re following and creators that you&#39;re not following that are generating interesting things and you just add on to that a layer of okay and we&#39;re also going to show you content from um that&#39;s generated by by an AI system that might be something that you&#39;re interested in now how big do any of these segments get I think it&#39;s really hard to know until you build them out over time but it feels like it is a category in the world that&#39;s going to exist and um how big it gets is kind of dependent on the execution and how good it is why do you think it needs to exist as a new category I&#39;m still wrestling with why people want this I get the companionship stuff that character Ai and some startups have already shown there&#39;s like a market for um and you&#39;ve talked about how Med is already being used for role playing and but the big idea is that AI has been used to inter intermediate in feed how humans reach each other and now all of a sudden AIS are going to be in feeds with us well I think the main difference and that feels big yeah but in a lot of ways the big change already happened which is people getting content that they weren&#39;t following and the definition of feeds in social interaction has changed very fundamentally in the last 10 years now in Social systems most of the direct interaction is happening in more private forums in messaging our groups and this is one of the reasons I think why we were late with reals initially to competing with Tik to is cu we we hadn&#39;t made this mental shift where we kind of felt like no feed is where you interact with people actually increasingly feat is becoming a place where you discover content that you then take to your private forums and interact with people there so a lot of the the the way that I interact with people it&#39;s like yeah I&#39;ll still have the thing where a friend will post something and I&#39;ll I&#39;ll comment on it and engage directly in feed um again you know this is additive you&#39;re adding more over time um but the main way that you engage with reals isn&#39;t necessarily that you know you go into the reals comments and comment and talk to people you don&#39;t know it&#39;s like you see something funny and you send it to friends in a group chat right and I I think that that Paradigm will absolutely continue with AI and all kinds of interesting content so it is facilitating connections with people um but I think already we&#39;re in this mode where our connections through social media are shifting to more private places and the role of Feed in the ecosystem is more as a you know I call it a discovery engine content to kind of um you know of ice breakers or interesting kind of topic starters for the conversations that you&#39;re having um across this like broader spectrum of places where you&#39;re interacting do you worry about people interacting with AIS like this making people less likely to talk to other people like it reducing the engagement that we have with humans the sociology that I&#39;ve seen on this is that most people have way fewer friends physically than they would like to have I think people cherish the kind of human connection that they have and the more we can do to make that feel more real and give you more reasons to connect whether it&#39;s through something funny that shows up so you can message someone or a pair of glasses that lets like you your sister show up as a hologram in your living room when you you know she lives across the country and you wouldn&#39;t be able to see her otherwise like that&#39;s always kind of our main bread and butter and the thing that we&#39;re doing but you know in addition to that I mean if the you know the average person I think you know maybe they&#39;d like to have 10 friends and I mean there&#39;s the stat that it&#39;s like it&#39;s sort of sad but I think the the average American feels like they have fewer than three like real kind of close friends so does this take away from that my guess is no I I think that what&#39;s going to happen is it&#39;s going to help um give people more of the support that they need and give people more kind of reasons and ability to connect with either a broader range of people or more deeply with the people who they care about how are you feeling about how threads is doing these days I mean threads on fire it&#39;s great I mean it&#39;s I mean these things it&#39;s like there&#39;s only so quickly that something can get to a billion people so it&#39;s G to you know we&#39;ll kind of keep on pushing on it over I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s still using Instagram a lot for growth like I&#39;m guess I&#39;m wondering when do you see it getting to like a I mean of Standalone growth driver on its own I mean I think that these things all connect to each other so I I don&#39;t I mean I think threads helps Instagram I think Instagram helps threads I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that we have some strategic goal which is like like make it so that threads is completely disconnected from Instagram or Facebook I actually think we&#39;re going the other direction it started off just connected to Instagram and now we also connected it so that the content can show up now taking a step back I me we just talked about how for most people they&#39;re interacting in more private forums if you&#39;re a Creator what you want to do is have your content show up everywhere right because you&#39;re trying to build the biggest community that you can in these different places so it&#39;s this huge value um for for people if they can generate a real or a video or some text based content and now you can post it in Threads Instagram Facebook um and more places over time so um so I think the direction there is generally kind of more flow not less and kind of more interoperability and that&#39;s that&#39;s why um I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been kind of pushing on that as as a theme over time I&#39;m not even sure what x is anymore but I think what it used to be and what Twitter used to be was a place where you went when news was happening I know you and the company seem to be distancing yourself from recommending news but with threads it feels like that&#39;s what people want and people thought threads might be but it seems like you all are intentionally saying we don&#39;t want threads to actually be that yeah I mean it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s there are different ways to to look at this um I always looked at Twitter not as primarily about realtime news but as a kind of short form primarily text discussion oriented app to me the fundamental defining aspect of that format is that you don&#39;t when you make a post the comments aren&#39;t subordinate to the Post the comments are kind of at a pure level and that is a very different architecture than every other type of of um of social network that&#39;s out there and um it&#39;s a subtle difference but Within These systems these subtle differences lead to very different emerging behaviors so because of that people can take they can Fork discussions and it makes it a very good discussion oriented platform now news is one thing that people like discussing um but it&#39;s not the only thing and I always looked at Twitter and I was like hey this is such a wasted opportunity like this is clearly a billion person app um you know maybe in the modern day when you have multiple like many billions of people using social apps it should be multiple billions of people and for whatever reason I mean there was there are a lot of things that have been complicated about Twitter and the corporate structure and all that but they just weren&#39;t quite getting there and eventually you know I kind of thought hey I think we can do this I think we can get this like build out the discussion platform in in a way that can get to a billion people and be more of a ubiquitous social platform that I think achieves the um the fullness of what what what what it like its full potential but our version of this is we wanted to be a Kinder place right we don&#39;t want to start with kind of the like direct kind of head-to-head combat of news um and especially politics and um you feel like that constrains the growth of the product at all I mean I think I think we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll run the experiment um or that that needs to exist in the world cuz I feel like with x&#39;s seeming implosion it&#39;s not really existing anymore maybe I&#39;m biased to someone in the media but I do think I do think people want when something big happens in the world they want an app that they can go to and see everyone that they follow talking about it immediately yeah well there&#39;s not we&#39;re not the only company I there&#39;s there were like a ton of different competitors and different companies doing things and you know I mean I think that there&#39;s a talented team over at Twitter and and um so so I I I I wouldn&#39;t write them off um and you know then obviously there&#39;s all these other folks and there&#39;s a lot of startups that are doing stuff so I don&#39;t feel like we have to go with that first I I think that like maybe we get there over time or maybe we decide that it&#39;s enough of a zero sum trade or maybe even a negative sum trade where like that that use case should exists somewhere but maybe that use case prevents a lot more usage um and and kind of a lot more value in other places because it makes it a somewhat less friendly place and um I I don&#39;t think we know the answer to that yet but I I do think the last 10 years eight years of um of our experience has been that the political discourse is um it&#39;s It&#39;s Tricky right it&#39;s on the one hand it&#39;s obviously a very important thing in society and on the other hand I don&#39;t think it leaves people feeling good so I&#39;m torn between these two values on the one hand I I think like people should be able to have this kind of open discourse and that&#39;s good on the other hand I don&#39;t want to design a product that makes people angry right it&#39;s like I mean is like there&#39;s an informational lens for looking at this and there&#39;s kind of a you&#39;re designing a product and like what&#39;s the feel of the product right it&#39;s like I think anyone who&#39;s designing a product cares a lot about how the thing feels and but you Rec you recognize the importance of that discussion happening in the world I think it&#39;s useful and look we don&#39;t block it you know we we just make it so that um you know for the content where you&#39;re following people if you want to talk to your friends about it if you want to talk to them about it in messaging there can be groups about it um if you follow people it can show up in your feed but we don&#39;t go out of our way to recommend that content when you&#39;re not following it and I think that that has been a healthy balance for us and for getting our products to generally feel the way that we want um and you know culture changes over time maybe the stuff will be like a little bit less polarized and anger inducing at some point and maybe it&#39;ll be possible to have more of that while also at the same time having a product where we&#39;re proud of how it feels but until then I think we we just we want to we want to design a product that um yeah people can get the things that they want but um but you know fundamentally we we um I care a lot about how people feel coming away from the products do you see this decision to to downrank political content for people that who aren&#39;t being followed um in feed as a political decision I guess because I don&#39;t know you&#39;re also at the same time you know not really saying much about the election this year you&#39;re not donating you&#39;ve said you kind of want to stay out of it now and I see the way the company&#39;s acting and it reflects your personal kind of way you&#39;re operating right now and I&#39;m wondering like how much more of it is also about what you and the company have gone through and the political environment and not necessarily just what users are telling you sure um like is there a through line there I I mean I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all connected I think in this case it wasn&#39;t a trade-off between those two things because this actually was what our community was telling us and people were saying generally we don&#39;t want so much politics it it like this isn&#39;t you know like we don&#39;t feel good like like I we want like we we want content to that we want more stuff from our friends and family we want more stuff from our interests um so that that was kind of the primary driver but I think it&#39;s definitely the case that our corporate experience on this um shaped this and there&#39;s a big difference between something being political and being partisan and the main thing that I care about is making sure that we can be seen as a nonpartisan and you know as much as something can in the world in 2024 be sort of like a trusted institution by as many people as possible and um I just think that the partisan politics is so tough in the world right now that um I&#39;ve made the decision that I I kind of feel like for me and for the company um best thing to do is to try to be as nonpartisan as possible in in in all of this and and kind of be be kind of as as neutral and and distance ourselves as much as possible and it&#39;s not just the substance I also think the perception matters so I think um so that&#39;s why you maybe you know it doesn&#39;t matter on our platforms whether I endorse a candidate or not but like I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t want to go anywhere near um and yeah I mean you could say that&#39;s a political strategy um but I think it&#39;s um I think for where we are in the world today it&#39;s very hard almost every institution has become partisan in some way and we are just trying to resist that and maybe I&#39;m too naive and maybe that&#39;s impossible but that&#39;s we&#39;re going to try to do that on the acquired podcast recently you said that the political miscalculation was a 20-year mistake and a brand from a brand perspective and was going to take another 10 or so for you to fully work through that cycle yeah what makes you think it&#39;s such a lasting thing because you look at like how you personally have kind of evolved over the last couple years and I think perception of the company has evolved and I&#39;m wondering like what you meant by saying it&#39;s going to take another 10 years I&#39;m just talking about where our brand is and our reputation are compared to where I think they would have been I mean there&#39;s no doubt that even now here and okay yeah sure maybe things have improved somewhat over the last few years you can feel the trend but it&#39;s still significantly worse than it was in 2016 um you know it&#39;s I mean the internet industry overall um and I think our company in particular um just were seeing way more positively and now look there were real issues right so so I I I I think that it&#39;s always very difficult to talk about this stuff in a nuanced way because um I think to some Dee before 2016 everyone was sort of too Rosy about the internet overall and didn&#39;t talk enough about the issues and then the pendulum sort of swung and people only talked about the issues and didn&#39;t talk about the stuff that was positive and it was all both there the whole time um but so when I talk about this I don&#39;t mean to you know come across as simplistic or um you know you guys didn&#39;t do anything wrong or anything like or that there weren&#39;t issues with the Internet or things like that I mean obviously every year you know whether it&#39;s politics or other things there always things that you look back at and you&#39;re like hey yeah like if I were playing this perfectly I would have done these things differently and um but I do think it&#39;s the case that I didn&#39;t really know how to react to something as big of of of sort of a shift in the world as what happened and it took me a while to find my footing and and I I I do think that It&#39;s Tricky when you&#39;re caught up in these kind of big debates and you&#39;re not kind of experienced or sophisticated and engaging with that I think um you can make some big missteps and I I do think that some of the things that um that that that we were accused of over time it just you know I think it&#39;s just been pretty clear at this point you know now that all the investigations have been done that like they they weren&#39;t true um and you&#39;re talking about like Cambridge analytica I think C analytica is a good example of something that it&#39;s like people thought that like all this data had been taken and that um it had been used in this campaign and out wasn&#39;t and like and yeah so it&#39;s like all the stuff okay the data wasn&#39;t even you know accessible to the to the developer and and we&#39;d fix the issue like five years ago so um but in the moment it was like really hard for us to to kind of have a rational discussion about that and I think part of the challenge is that um you know for the general population I think a lot of people they read the initial headlines and they don&#39;t necessarily read the um you know and and and frankly you know a lot of the media I don&#39;t think was like as loud to write about when all the invest concluded that said that there weren&#39;t um that like a lot of the initial allegations were just completely wrong so I I think that&#39;s like a that&#39;s a real thing so okay so you take these hits and I didn&#39;t really know how to how to kind of push back on that and maybe some of it you can&#39;t but I I like to think that I think we could have played this some of this stuff differently um and I do think it was certainly the case that when you take responsibility for things that are not your fault you become sort of a weak Target for people who are looking to blame other things and find a target for them and it&#39;s sort of like um this is a different part of of of it&#39;s it&#39;s somewhat related to this but when you think about like like litigation strategy for the company one of the reason why I hate settling lawsuits is that it it basically sends a signal to people that hey this is a company that settles lawsuits so maybe like we can sue them and they&#39;ll settle lawsuits so um so you wouldn&#39;t write a blank check to the government like Google did for its antitrust case no I think like I think the right kind of way to approach this is when you believe in something you fight really hard for it and I think this is a repeat game this isn&#39;t like this it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a single issue and we&#39;re going to be around for a long time and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s really important that people know that we&#39;re a company that has conviction and that we we believe in what we&#39;re doing and we&#39;re going to back that up and defend ourselves and I think that that kind of sets the right tone um now now I think over the next 10 years I think we&#39;re sort of digging ourselves back to neutral on this and but I I like to think that if we hadn&#39;t had a lot of these issues we would have made progress over the last 10 years too so I sort of give it this time frame maybe 20 years is too long maybe it&#39;s 15 but it&#39;s hard to know with politics it feels like mental health and youth mental health may be the next wave of this that that I think is the next big fight and and on that you know I think a lot of the data on this I I think is just not where the narrative is the The Narrative yeah I think the narrative is a lot of people sort of take it as um as if it&#39;s like an assumed thing that there&#39;s some link and like I think the majority of the of the high quality research that&#39;s out there suggests that there&#39;s no causal connection like a at kind of a broad scale between between these things so um now look I mean I think that that&#39;s different from saying like in any given issue like was is someone bullied should we try to stop bullying yeah of course um but yeah overall um I I I think that this is this is one where there there are a bunch of these cases I think that there will be a lot of litigation around them uh and it&#39;s one where we&#39;re trying to make sure that the academic research that that shows something that that I think is you it um you know to me it sort of foots more with what I&#39;ve seen of how the platforms operate but it&#39;s counter to what a lot of people think and I think that that&#39;s going to be a reckoning that we&#39;ll have to have is is basically when as the the kind of the majority of the highquality academic research um kind of gets shown is like Okay can people accept this and I think that&#39;s going to be a really important um set of debates over the next year at the same time you guys have acknowledged there&#39;s affordances in the product like the teen roll out with Instagram recently that you can make to make the product a better experience for young people yeah and I think this is an interesting part of the balance is um you can play a role in trying to make something better even if the thing wasn&#39;t caused by you in the first place like there&#39;s no doubt that being being a parent is really hard and there&#39;s a big question of in this internet age where we have phones um what are the right tools that parents need in order to be able to raise their kids and like I think that we can play a role in giving people controls over U parental controls over the apps I think that parental controls are also really important because parents have different ways that they want to raise their kids or just like schooling and education people have like very significantly different local preferences for how they want to raise their kids I don&#39;t think that most people want some internet company setting all the rules for this either so obviously you know when there are laws passed we&#39;ll we&#39;ll kind of follow the the the government&#39;s Direction and and and the laws on that but I actually think the right approach for us is to primarily kind of align with parents to give them the tools that they want to be able to raise their kids in the way that they want and some people are going to think that more technology use is good that&#39;s sort of how my parents you know Raised Me growing Up um I think it worked pretty well um some people are going to be kind of more more um you know want to limit it more and we want to give them the tools to be able to do that but but I don&#39;t think that this is you know primarily or only a social media thing um even even the parts of this that are technology age verification I think phones like the phone platforms have a huge part of this this I mean it&#39;s um yeah there&#39;s this big question of how do you do age verification and I mean I can tell you what the easiest way is which is like all right like every time you go do a payment on your phone I mean there already is child um you know basically like child age verification so I don&#39;t really understand well I guess I understand but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not very um you know excusable from my perspective why apple and and and um I guess to some extent Google don&#39;t want to just extend the age verification that they already have on their phones to be a parental control for parents to to basically be able to say what um you what apps can my kids use right it&#39;s hard for me to not see the logic in it either I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really I think they don&#39;t want to take responsibility but maybe that&#39;s on Congress then to pass who has to take responsibility yeah yeah so and and and we&#39;re going to do our part and we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to build the tools that we can for for parents and for and for teens um but it the end of the day um I I and look I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s all the phone&#39;s fault either although I I would say that like the ability to get push notifications and get kind of distracted is from my perspective seems like a much greater contributor to mental health issues than um than than kind of a lot of the specific apps but but there are things that that I think everyone should should kind of try to improve and work on um but yeah I mean I that that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s sort of my view on all that on the regul piece as it relates to AI you&#39;ve been very vocal about what&#39;s happening in the EU and uh you recently signed an open letter and I believe it was saying basically that you guys just don&#39;t have Clarity on consent for training how it&#39;s supposed to work um and I&#39;m wondering what you think needs to happen there for things to move forward because like Med AI is not available in Europe new llama models are not um is that something you see getting resolved uh at all I guess and what would it take yeah I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s a little hard for me to parse the the European politics um I have a hard time enough with American politics I mean it&#39;s and and I&#39;m I&#39;m American but um so in theory my understanding of the way this is supposed to work is they they kind of passed this gdpr regulation and you&#39;re supposed to have this this idea of sort of a One-Stop shop like home regulator who can basically on behalf of the whole EU interpret and enforce the rules and we have our European headquarters and we work with that regulator and you know I think they&#39;re like okay they&#39;re pretty tough on us and pretty firm but at least when you&#39;re working with one regulator you can kind of understand how are they thinking about things and it&#39;s and you can make progress and the thing that I think has been tricky is there there have been from from my perspective a little bit of a backslide where now you get all these other um dpas across the continent sort of also intervening and and trying to do things and it just seems like more of an kind of internal EU political thing which is like okay do they want to have this One-Stop shop and have Clarity for companies so companies can act can kind of like can execute or or do they just want it to be this kind of very complicated regulatory system and um I look I think that&#39;s for them to out um but but I know there&#39;s no doubt that when you have like dozens of different Regulators that can ask you kind of the same questions about different things it makes it a much more difficult environment to build things do you do I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s just us I think that that&#39;s all the company but do you understand the concern people have about training data and creators even and this idea that their data is being used for these models they&#39;re not getting compensated and the models are creating a lot of value and I know you&#39;re giving away llama but you&#39;re still you&#39;ve got M Ai and I understand the frustration that people have about that I think it&#39;s a naturally bad feeling to be like oh my my data is now being used in a new way that I have no control or compensation over do you do you sympathize with that yeah I mean I think that there in any new medium and Technology there&#39;s like the concepts around fair use and like where are the boundaries between what you have control over right when you put something out in the world to what degree do you still get to control it and and kind of own it and license it um and I I think that all these things are basically going to get need to get you know relitigated and rediscussed in the um in the in the AI era so I&#39;m I get it I I I think that these are these are important questions I think this is not like a completely novel thing to AI in in the grand scheme of things I think it was you a lot of them there were questions about it with with the internet overall too and with different Technologies over time um and but I think getting to clarity that is going to be important so that way the things that Society wants people to build they can go build what is Clarity look like to you there I mean I think it starts with having some framework of like okay what&#39;s the process going to be if we&#39;re working through that but but you don&#39;t see a scenario where creators get like directly compensated for the use of their content I think that there&#39;s a lot of different possibilities for how stuff goes in the future now I do think that there&#39;s this issue which is a lot of like while psychologically I understand what you&#39;re saying yeah I think individual creators or Publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content right so it&#39;s like okay maybe like in in in like in the grand scheme of this right so um so we have this set of challenges with with um you know news Publishers around the world which is like okay they they&#39;re like a lot of folks are constantly kind of asking to be paid for the content and on the other hand we have of our community which is asking us to show less news because it makes them feel bad right and I mean we talked about that so it&#39;s like there&#39;s this issue which is okay it&#39;s like actually we&#39;re showing some amount of the news that we&#39;re showing because we think it&#39;s socially important against what our community wants like if we were actually just following our our our what our what our community wants we&#39;d show even less than we&#39;re showing um and you see that in the data that people just don&#39;t like to engage with this stuff and we&#39;ve had these issues where sometimes we like Publishers say okay if you&#39;re not going to pay us then pull our cont down and it&#39;s just like yeah Share Fine pull pull your content down I mean that sucks I&#39;d rather people be able to share it but but if but I think some to some degree some of these questions have to get tested by their negotiations and they have to get tested by people walking and and like and then at the end once people walk you figure out where the value really is right if if it if it really is the case that that news was a big thing the community wanted then I mean look we&#39;re we&#39;re a big company we could you know we we could probably you know we pay for Content when it&#39;s valuable to people we&#39;re just not going to pay for Content when it&#39;s not valuable to people um so I think that you&#39;ll probably see a similar Dynamic with AI which is my guess is that there are going to be certain Partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable um and i&#39; guess that there&#39;s probably a lot of people who are kind of have a a concern about like the feel of it like you&#39;re saying but then when push comes to shove if like if they demanded that we take that we don&#39;t use their content then we just wouldn&#39;t use their content and it&#39;s not like you know that&#39;s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much I guess to bring this full circle where we started uh as you&#39;re building augmented reality glasses um and what you&#39;ve learned over just the societal implications of the stuff you&#39;ve built over the last decade um how are you thinking about this as it relates to glasses at scale because you&#39;re literally going to be augmented augmenting reality which is a it&#39;s a responsibility I think that&#39;s going to be another platform too and you&#39;re going to have a lot of these questions as well I mean I think the interesting thing about Holograms and augmented reality is it&#39;s going to be this intermingling of the physical and digital much more than we&#39;ve had in other platforms um where on your phone it&#39;s like okay yeah we we live a primarily physical world but then you have the small window into this digital world and I think we&#39;re going to basically have this world in the future that is increasingly you know call it half physical half digital or I don&#39;t know 60% physical 40% digital and it&#39;s like and it&#39;s um going to be Blended together and I think that there are going to be a lot of interesting governance questions around that right in terms of um like is is kind of all of the digital stuff that&#39;s overlaid physically going to fit within sort of a physical kind of national regulation perspective or is it sort of is it actually coming from a different world or something you know and and um I think these will all be very interesting questions that we will have a perspective I&#39;m sure we&#39;re not going to be right about every single thing um I I think like the world will kind of need to sort out where it wants to be different countries will have different values and take somewhat different approaches on things and I think that that&#39;s it&#39;s part of the interesting process of this the the tapestry of how it all gets built is like is um you need to work through so that it ends up being positive for you know as many of the possible stakeholders as possible more to come yeah a lot to come yeah thanks Mark okay cool good game good game you you haveen anage that&#39;s all right I&#39;ve played a few more cool all right done"

      "subtitles": "welcome to the vergecast the flagship podcast of things code named Strawberry I&#39;m your friend David Pierce and I am currently in the Miami International Airport I just spent the weekend touring colleges with my nephew and suddenly I&#39;m like college is awesome I can go back to college I don&#39;t think I do very well I don&#39;t think I would get in anywhere I think my test scores would be awful if you&#39;re like Hey how do you do calculus I don&#39;t know I have nothing for you but suddenly College seems pretty appealing so who knows maybe this will be the end of my vergecast career and I&#39;ll just go back to school or something but anyway that is not what we&#39;re here to talk about today we are here to talk about two things we&#39;re doing a little bit of a catchup on some kind of ongoing news happening in the tech industry first we&#39;re going to talk about open AI which has been doing a bunch of sort of odd new work with different kinds of models and a new thing that they call a reasoning model 01 some strange corporate changes Lots just going on at open AI so I figured it&#39;s been a while since Kylie Robinson came on the show and told us what&#39;s going on so Kylie&#39;s gonna come on the show and tell us what&#39;s going on then we&#39;re going to talk about a bunch of ongoing legal and Regulatory things we have the Tik Tock ban or not ban ongoing we have a bunch of questions about the Google adtec trial we have whatever that Trump crypto thing was from a week or so ago so we&#39;re going to catch up on all of that too all of that is coming up in just a sec plus a really fun hotline question that made me feel a lot of feelings about my own life as these are want to do but first uh legitimately as as of right this second I just got the notification that my plan is boarding so time to fly home we&#39;ll be right back welcome back all right let&#39;s get into it first thing I want to talk about is AI so it&#39;s been a busy summer of AI stuff and in particular I&#39;ve been really fascinated by this thing that has happened really for the last year where you have a handful of companies you have Google you have open AI you have anthropic you have meta constantly leap frogging each other with new models it&#39;s like every 2 weeks somebody comes out with a new model that benchmarks better than anybody else&#39;s model and it&#39;s cheaper and then 2 weeks later one of the other companies does it and we&#39;ve just been on this Relentless pace of everything getting slightly better and I keep asking the question and trying to figure it out for myself of what does this mean like at what point do all of these changes add up to something meaningfully different about how you use your devices and how you interact with computers and how computers interact with you and each other and so far I don&#39;t have great answers everything&#39;s getting better but it doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;re getting tons of huge new changes if you listen to Sunday&#39;s episode you heard Stephen Johnson talk about Gemini&#39;s context window I think that&#39;s a good example but there haven&#39;t been that many moments like that but then opening ey last week released a thing called 01 which is a new model that is very different and seems to speak to kind of a different direction for these models to go they&#39;re not just getting bigger and faster and cheap cheaper to run but kind of along the same lines this is open AI saying something different about how a model might work and how you might use it and what it might mean those things are sometimes enticing and sometimes terrifying so I figured it&#39;s time to talk our way through it so I asked Kylie Robinson to come back on the show she hasn&#39;t been here in a little while and I figured be a good time to dive in let&#39;s do it Kylie welcome back hello it&#39;s been a minute I feel like every time I want to talk to you you&#39;re like it burning man that&#39;s true that is exactly what happened last time um or on a crazy vacation yes happy to be back it&#39;s a tough life honestly I know being 26 and SF it&#39;s terrible seems like it well you were a dream Force this week which is objectively terrible no comment but yes uh but I have I have brought you here because there keeps being interesting AI stuff uh and specifically I want to talk about uh 01 open ai&#39;s new model which first I just want you to explain to me I have many questions and feelings and thoughts about this that I want to go over but I mostly just want to know like what is one and why does it exist yeah so 01 is open ai&#39;s new quote unquote reasoning model and I think you can argue about what reasoning is for a million years so I won&#39;t but that&#39;s what they&#39;re claiming and it is the next step in about five steps to AGI for this is reasoning is really important to them and more practically what users and researchers are finding is that this model is better at hard math problems and coding assignments okay why what like what when you say a reasoning model yeah I feel like we&#39;ve been hearing people say AI is good at reasoning yeah for a very long time so to come out with a reasoning model makes it seem like something is meaningfully like structurally different here like what is that thing so they basically trained the model to think step by step so previously you might see a workaround with gbt 4 or 4 o that was like okay give me answer and I want you to think through it step by step so they basically trained the model to do that itself rather than have the user do that um and through a lot of reinforcement learning which looks like how you would train a dog with treats and you know penalties that&#39;s how I explain it and people online are like now I feel bad for the model how is it penalized but it also gets treats like it&#39;s it also gets treats so um that&#39;s also led to this thing called reward hacking that I wrote about it&#39;s very deep rabbit hole but yeah yeah so it&#39;s trained to reason in these ways and then it has this thing called a chain of thought that we can&#39;t see for competition purposes and safety purposes is what they claim uh so it just shows like okay I&#39;m I&#39;m breaking this down XYZ ways it&#39;s it&#39;s the I&#39;m breaking this down thing that throws me because we&#39;ve seen a bunch of screenshots and uh I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve used it much I haven&#39;t really used it much it&#39;s like it&#39;s kind of out there now uh folks are playing with it uh it&#39;s it&#39;s trying hard to talk out loud as if it&#39;s a person thinking through a problem which is a weird when a person does it like if you&#39;ve ever sat and like listen to Somebody try to reason through a hard problem it&#39;s bizarre and doesn&#39;t make any sense uh and to have a computer sort of attempt to Brute Force its way through the same thing and it&#39;s using like I pronouns and it&#39;s it&#39;s wondering and it&#39;s thinking about it it&#39;s like you&#39;re not doing any of those things and uh I don&#39;t know there there just seems to be this thing where opening I is pushing much much much harder into this thing should sort of be like a person right like I can&#39;t get the idea of the voice mode coming out right before this right which is like you put those two things together and like I I that&#39;s if if it works that&#39;s something really powerful am I overthinking what open AI is trying to do here do you think no that was my first reaction when they were demoing it for me I think I put that in the story too which was like it says I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m like this you aren&#39;t a thing you aren&#39;t I yeah you&#39;re not wondering anything yes computer um so I get CU that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been taught as I you know work on this beat is do not do that don&#39;t say it&#39;s thinking because it isn&#39;t uh so why do they do that I asked them and they gave me sort of a roundabout answer is we don&#39;t believe in anthropomorphizing this whatsoever it&#39;s just sort of the easiest language to default to which I get because I think it&#39;s really hard even as I write about this to not use these statements but I think you have to just work hard to not do that you know because it isn&#39;t thinking right it is it is really hard to describe what it&#39;s doing it with a word other than thinking yes but it&#39;s not thinking and so I find myself constantly writing things where it&#39;s like it&#39;s thinking and then in parenthesis you&#39;re like well it&#39;s not actually thinking but you know what I mean and it&#39;s like I agree like all the vocabulary for this is bad but it does sometimes feel like that&#39;s still the best that we have exactly the other thing that I find fascinating about this model is the the sort of safety reaction to it uh both from open ai&#39;s own researchers which I think they gave it what like a medium risk scorecard for uh biological like weapons risks yeah that doesn&#39;t make me feel better like that&#39;s I feel like they put that out and they&#39;re like it&#39;s fine it&#39;s only a medium risk like that feels like a lot but then you also talk to a researcher who raised some like sincerely honestly alarming stuff like what what is the what is different about this one that it is it is making people nervous I think what fascinated that researcher is this is the first time he had witnessed sort of the manipulation aspect I think I explained this story to my dad the other day who is not plugged into Ai and I&#39;m his only source of information and I started with I&#39;m going to use a lot of these words that I don&#39;t use in the article because you&#39;re not supposed to anthropomorphize it uh but you know and I&#39;ll do the same here just for time sake but it&#39;s you know it had checked to see if if the developers were watching before making a decision is something a researcher found it found that it is so goal oriented that it is willing to break guardrails to get you an answer for example in the research there was the brownie test it asked for the user asked for a brownie recipe uh and it knew it shows in its Chain of Thought I don&#39;t have access to this information I don&#39;t have access to the internet but I want to give this user an answer so badly that I am going to make up this information in order to you know succeed in its goal so that&#39;s a form of reward hacking that I wrote about wait so it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t go to the internet to answer questions it it invented yes links to web pages with brownie recipes it invented a a Blog it was like Sam&#39;s brownie recipes or something it invented a Blog but it knew that it was incorrect it just didn&#39;t want to admit that it was incorrect what yeah because it wants the reward it knows is rewarded for giving an answer so but it&#39;s also as the uh researcher told me it needs to be helpful honest it it it it knows it&#39;s guardrails but some of those it finds these aren&#39;t super helpful when I&#39;m trying to get an answer right I if if it wants to be all of those things but job number one is go answer the question yes it it will do this is the science fiction stuff like you just described act one of every movie that ends in in everyone dies in act three because of AI do you know the paperclip story this is like kind of a famous AI story basically an AI the tldr is the AI uh I can&#39;t remember the user prompt that&#39;s like uh how do I get as many paper clips as possible or something and it turns the entire world into paper clips like it&#39;s like so so that&#39;s kind of the thing is that and that&#39;s what the researcher was telling me about in the story that he&#39;s like listen it&#39;s not capable of you know turning us all into paper clipse right now but say it does advance in the ways that open AI wants it to advance then you know someday we tell it you know cure cancer and it realizes well I need a lot of uh money to do this and I need a lot of humans to do this and it&#39;s willing to break these guard rails to achieve this goal which is a very sci-fi way to look at it yeah it&#39;s like okay I can cure cancer but only with millions of human bodies to test this on and it&#39;s like cast that out far enough I try so hard not to be like a tin foil hat AI person um generally because I believe the best and worst possibilities are less crazy than everybody makes them out to be that like realistically we&#39;re going to end up somewhere between like a four and a six out of 10 no matter what the thing is but it is this one is particularly wild to me just in the context of what&#39;s going on in open AI right which is that the other news of this company is that it is pushing ever harder toward being a for-profit company like officially taking off the we want to do good by the world shackles and they&#39;re just going to go make money they also launched a a safety board which I I think most people would argue at this point is kind of a sham please correct me if I&#39;m wrong but like every evidence from what open AI has been up to over the last year suggest that that&#39;s a sham like it seems to me that there are reasons to be nervous about the trajectory of a company that would launch this model at this moment yes but maybe I&#39;m just freaking out for no reason no I asked a researcher I trust about that safety board a safety researcher and they said that it&#39;s mostly window dressing in their opinion that&#39;s that&#39;s what they thought I think this has been the hardest job I have had in my short career is walking this tight rope of and the pressure of getting it correct because it is so complex and Technical and not only that open AI is has such Grand claims that they and they are not proven yet and they are currently raising I just the morning there was news that they are closing the largest funding round in history at $6.5 billion at $150 billion valuation Lord oh yeah and I was reading it&#39;s it&#39;s over subscribed more people want to be in it than can be in it yes exactly and the the minimum uh Thrive capital is leading it and the minimum of investment is $250 million wow it is it is unprecedented and really hard for me to wrap my head around yeah and it just feels like whatever you want to believe about the future uh if sufficiently good AI will save us or sufficiently good AI will kill us it feels like open AI is perfectly happy to just run down the road as fast as it possibly can no matter what 100% so the the this reasoning model though is is just keeps throwing me for that exact reason like why if you&#39;re open AI launch this model even open AI did its own testing it&#39;s it&#39;s a medium risk right like the the company has they&#39;ve talked big game for years about wanting to do this safely and wanting to take their time and it&#39;s a complicated moment in the AI space and all this stuff like what&#39;s psycle analyzed Sam ultman and Co here for me for a minute why why do this right now um well Altman said this week at a conference he said he likened the capabilities of 01 to gpt2 in 2019 so it&#39;s not that capable of their models I think releasing it my my jaded side is that it&#39;s it&#39;s capitalism they need to raise this money they need something to show for it like we&#39;re asking for more money than anyone has ever asked for so we need something to show for it even if it&#39;s a half-baked reasoning model um and their their position is also we need user feedback we need the data because we can&#39;t just do this in-house forever we need to release it at some point so we can see how it performs and how it can be better so that that&#39;s the their position but yeah it&#39;s a to me it&#39;s a funding and a competition standpoint you know everyone else is going to be coming out Google&#39;s already claimed that they have reasoning models it&#39;s just it&#39;s the next stage for what they&#39;re gearing up to do which is uh quote unquote agents yeah walk me through that a little bit because I think my next question was going to be why raise this much money right now and on the one hand you might as well right like that&#39;s sort of the story of the tech industry is like if somebody will give you money you mostly take it uh but it also does seem like I have a bunch of thoughts about this like specific moment we&#39;re at in the sort of AI productization Universe uh but as as you&#39;re saying with the the agent stuff it it feels like there is a thing that&#39;s next uh is and is this is this6 and a half billion dollars to get to that thing like do you think it&#39;s as simple as that well yes and no but yes uh they have five levels to AGI so it&#39;s chatbots number one reasoners which is the reasoning agents number three four is innovators so these agents can help with you know inventing cures to diseases and then number five is organization so they can do the work of whole companies this is something they laid out very recently I just want to say by the way whoever came up with that genius like the way you just describe that sounds so reasonable and it makes sense and I can sort of see how it one flows into the other and then it&#39;s like as soon as you start to pick it apart it all just becomes insane but like totally as a copyrighting exercise like crushed it great job open AI precisely yes and I explained this and this is something I&#39;ve argued with readers about I explain this not because I think that we are there yet or on our way to AGI but because this is what they genuinely believe they&#39;re building like they think that they&#39;re building God I think that&#39;s important to lay out so uh agents is you know I think it means different things to different organizations for example Salesforce build dreamforce as the biggest AI conference in the world and they called it agent force because um only a few weeks and I was there all week um there&#39;s this fabulous photo of uh me demoing this with Benny off for hours um it&#39;s basically a slack bot that will create a customer service bot for you and it&#39;s they&#39;re building it as an AI agent so um Custer service chatbots are one component of Agents right so replacing repetitive tasks for open AI uh the repetitive task they want to replaces everything every repetitive task you can doing things yeah people doing things so they&#39;re hoping reasoning can help agents make more informed decisions and do your life for you this is what everybody wants right like this is now the path it seems like and uh I mean this is this like rabbit was talking about this at CES this year right like that is that is what everybody wants want to do and I think to some extent that as an end point makes sense right like I I think there is no evidence that anyone is building God at this moment in time but the idea that we are that they are on a real path to building things that can do things for you on your behalf yeah seems real right like I I I think we&#39;ve been on that path for longer than people want to say like you go back to like the Google Duo thing where it would call a restaurant and make you a reservation yeah that&#39;s an old school communication mechanism but that&#39;s the same idea yeah uh and it it does feel like you know you talk to you talk to Google and you talk to Apple about the Apple intelligence stuff and like that&#39;s the idea of all of this is go execute tasks on your behalf and I I guess what I wonder is is there any particular reason to believe open AI is going to get there before anybody else like I&#39;ve become this is the other thing I want to talk to about I&#39;ve become totally obsessed with this thing that seems to have happened where anthropic a few months ago released Claude 3.5 MH and all of a sudden everyone I know who uses AI tools is like oh this is the best one yeah it&#39;s more fun it&#39;s more interesting it&#39;s more creative it&#39;s like this is just the best one and it just happened and all of a sudden open AI went from being like the the Goliath in the room to everybody being like like their Tech is cool but this is there are a lot of companies that make cool Tech and the stuff is being commoditized and yeah it like AI seems cool but do do we need open AI to be the the sort of harbinger of all this and then open eye is like we&#39;re raising all of the money in the universe at the highest valuation in the history of the universe here we are and I just I can&#39;t figure out what it is that is still so sexy about open AI in this moment I mean no one has the users for their chatbot like open AI does fair that&#39;s a fair point I think that&#39;s what I think about when I think of anthropics chatbot and for instance grock XIs chatbot so you know that is I try not to think about groc generally speaking grock sometimes appears and and that&#39;s okay but I don&#39;t yeah I just leave grock over there unless you need um the president&#39;s holding a bomb like we don&#39;t really need grock yet so in terms of mass adoption cases yeah exactly so yeah I think that Chad gbt is a household name and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to change anytime soon and that&#39;s you know good for them I think that any company right now is looking for a way to justify why they&#39;re spending millions and billions of dollars on compute or like AI research they need something to show for it and I think agents is the next thing they&#39;re reaching for whether they&#39;re going to get there or not whether these are going to be useful I like really remains to be seen but that is all what they&#39;re working on because they see a product that could justify why they&#39;re spending so much time and money on this that&#39;s fair is it possible that search GPT is that thing for open AI like that&#39;s not quite an agent but it it does feel like I I totally buy the case yeah that chat GPT is not a killer app for anything uh I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been saying this forever and I feel very Vindicated by it because people are starting to come around and a chatbot is not the future of computing it just isn&#39;t like I just isn&#39;t uh and I think a thing I&#39;ve started to hear from more and more people that is that open AI is a company that&#39;s really good at technology and really bad at product and so I buy I buy the theory that like if you can do agents well and first that becomes a thing that it&#39;s like oh now I now you&#39;ve built something I can use that is more than just like a novelty computer to talk to it&#39;s like actually useful tool on my behalf still kind of feel like everybody&#39;s working on that but I also think there&#39;s a nonzero chance that that thing might be searched GPT which they announced and then sort of H seemed like just stopped talking about do you use perplexity more than Google no God yeah so I don&#39;t think so I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s going to be using AI power search more than they&#39;re just using Google and what&#39;s built into their devices which is why there&#39;s huge antitrust lawsuits in such well yeah that might change yeah uh but yeah I no I don&#39;t see search GPT being their next killer thing okay we we&#39;re all forgetting about Sora throwback Sora that just yeah is hang I did forget about I straight up did forget about Sora okay Sora being the the video model exactly that is very good/ horrifying I think they&#39;re all an open a included are I think open AI builds itself as more you know research focused like these are just the toys to show off their models that are so powerful but um they need to make money and hence why they are not going to be a nonprofit according to reports like the agents um I think are going to be what they&#39;re hoping works best for them and yeah humanizing them early makes a lot of sense in terms of the product Vision yeah that&#39;s fair do you actually think open AI is happy being like infrastructure kind of Enterprise company like there is a version of it that open AI decides you know we want to be I don&#39;t know we want to be AWS not amazon.com right and it turns out that&#39;s a really good business and it&#39;s not sexy yeah but you don&#39;t get hauled in front of Congress and you make all the money in the known universe and open AI could go that way it could be developer focused it could be the back end of everything it&#39;s kind of doing that successfully already but I just can&#39;t shake this idea that that&#39;s not actually what open AI wants no I don&#39;t think so just an infrastructure company again I think it it can&#39;t even be compared to Amazon or AWS they think that they&#39;re building God can you can I&#39;m trying like you I do think Andy jasse does not sit around thinking about building God exact I I&#39;m you&#39;ve had a very long and successful career what is a company you can compare like that they thought they were building God every nft company that existed uh no I think I think that&#39;s right and I think the it&#39;s been the strangest thing for me about trying to cover this stuff is I have never encountered a group of people who earnestly believe something that big yeah is right around the corner like even people 25 years ago when I was not covering this stuff because I&#39;m not that old Kylie uh who were talking about like the internet was going to change everything they weren&#39;t talking about God right like there was no question of the a new human relationship ship with an entity more powerful than us like that thing is new yes and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s real to be clear again I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence that it&#39;s real or going to be real anytime in our lifetimes but a lot of people really sincerely believe that is what they&#39;re working on and I I still have not wrapped my head around what to do about that yeah it&#39;s very strange and it is true if you believe you&#39;re God you if you believe you&#39;re building God you&#39;re sure as hell not building AWS exactly exactly I have talked to like the extreme optimists and the extreme pessimists uh regularly and the only thing I know is that this is the most stressed I&#39;ve been covering any technology ever because it can be argued forever and ever uh the people who are building it genuinely yes believe they&#39;re they&#39;re building God and that this is all possible and we&#39;re going to reach AGI and I asked someone I was at a Time Magazine dinner on Monday and I asked a really important technologist that I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m allowed to name I asked them do you believe in your heart or do you believe in your wallet that you are building AGI right now and he was like I genuinely believe in my heart that that is what we&#39;re building uh it&#39;s a level of delusion I can respect um and then you know the pessimists think that this is just going to be a complete nothing Burger it&#39;s just going to implode which I get so listening to both these points and it coming down to sort of a philosophical argument is is this thing thinking is it reasoning the like it comes down to that every day and it&#39;s wild it&#39;s it&#39;s just insane yeah I just want to say for the record robots if you&#39;re listening Kylie said delusion I didn&#39;t saved delusion I do it&#39;s I think you&#39;re terrific don&#39;t don&#39;t get it twisted uh so we&#39;re about to enter this this really interesting phase for the rest of the year right I think meta connect is is coming we&#39;re going to hear a bunch of AI stuff from meta Gemini is still chugging along Apple intelligence is sort of kind of starting a little bit ship does it feel like we&#39;re heading into kind of a new moment of AI it&#39;s the agent stuff it&#39;s all of this like it it it sort of feels like if ever this stuff is going to go legit and mainstream it might start now you know I am impressed with uh open ai&#39;s ability to help me choose my medical insurance that happened recently oh yeah I just turned 26 and so I needed to figure out medical insurance and it helped me choose based off what I was concerned about the best medical insurance did it give it gave you like a real company that exists that you I gave it a PDF of my options okay so I was like so like I don&#39;t understand all this jargon can you please break it down for me this is what I need out of the insurance which one should I pick and it was helpful so its ability to parse information can be really helpful I am not fully convinced further than that because it&#39;s so much hype and so much marketing and so much money involved that I just don&#39;t see us reaching this super intelligent model that is capable of reasoning on my behalf and taking over my laptop and doing tasks for me I don&#39;t see us reaching that anytime soon but I just talked to like a safety re researcher who who thinks that I&#39;m completely wrong and that in three months that I&#39;m going to regret thinking this so I don&#39;t know uh I I&#39;m just not fully convinced yet yeah that&#39;s fair and and 01 didn&#39;t push you any further than that Direction I thought 01 was actually really cool when I demoed it because I I like being able to see how it is breaking down a problem uh but no do I think it&#39;s really intelligent or solving any really genuinely Earth shattering problems no not yet yeah and there&#39;s a certain amount of like showing your work is only impressive if you&#39;re still ending up at the right answer exactly and uh I think it it very much remains to be seen how often it is actually going to arrive at the right answer exactly I have I think a bit of a higher tolerance than most about you know spending the time and money on figuring out if this is going to be good for Humanity or not I think that&#39;s okay if it&#39;s sure [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and you know being weird I think it&#39;s fine until we figure it out but it can&#39;t be forever and I think I&#39;m more allergic to the hype and the like this is going to change the world and our SAS product is going to make you 10x more productive it&#39;s that I&#39;m allergic to yeah that&#39;s totally fair uh just remember that crypto did change the world just the way that everybody said it was going to and so did nfts so many good memes and we&#39;re doing this on a web 3 platform right now so everybody&#39;s right when they talk about everything that&#39;s going to change the world great Point what I would leave you with yeah you&#39;re welcome all right well thank you for coming to my occasional existential crisis about AI Kylie we&#39;re going to do this a lot more this year now you&#39;re not there&#39;s no more Burning Man until next September so now you have to come on the vergecast sometimes I&#39;m going to start sounding insane so good luck the rest of the year I&#39;m really excited all right we got to take a break and then we&#39;re going to come back and we&#39;re going to talk about some policy stuff we&#39;ll be right [Music] back all right we&#39;re back let&#39;s talk politics but not like not really like don&#39;t worry we&#39;re not going to yell about politics but there are some interesting things happening right now in the kind of legal regulatory world and also there is a politics thing Happ happening but I promise we&#39;re not going to spend too much time on that I asked Gabby delv and Addy Robertson on our team to come on and just kind of do a run through with me we&#39;ve got to talk about Tik Tok we&#39;ve got to talk about Google we&#39;ve got to talk about crypto we&#39;re just going to blast through all of it see if we can catch up and then we don&#39;t have to talk about politics for a minute which personally makes me very excited here on the vergecast but sometimes sometimes we got to do it so let&#39;s do it Addie welcome back hi Gabby hello welcome to the show hi thank you first time this is very exciting I&#39;m thrilled I can tell that was that was the enthusiasm I was looking for right there well I I smiled they can&#39;t hear that but I did smile that&#39;s just what my voice sounds like there&#39;s always a little bit of sarcasm in it it&#39;s all right I&#39;ll take it um okay so I want to do three things while the three of us are here together I want to talk about the the Tik Tock hearing I want to talk about Trump&#39;s crypto thing I don&#39;t even know what to call it we&#39;re going to talk about that um and then I want to talk briefly about where we are in the Google adtech trial no one get out of here does that sound good great okay sounds good let&#39;s start with Tik Tok because uh if I&#39;m being completely honest with you I had like completely lost track of all this Tik Tok stuff I feel like kind of like the last time they shot to B on Tik Tok I just sort of forgot about it and then it went away and I felt very Justified about that uh but there was a big hearing and it it appears we are we are still in the process of figuring out what&#39;s going on so Gabby can you just give me kind of the rundown of of what happened at this hearing yeah so first I want to talk a little bit about what happened before the hearing which is that the government introduced um a bunch of classified material in its filings and they were like the judge can look at this we can look at it Tik Tok can&#39;t look at it because it&#39;s a national security concern so we can talk about it to a point but there is just some stuff that we don&#39;t know because it&#39;s like pages and pages of redacted material the actual hearing did not focus too much on the redacted material it was more about um the on the one hand Tik Tok saying that the government did not really consider all of the possible options and on the other hand the government being like well actually we did negotiate with you guys for three years I believe Edie was it three years or was it two so Tik Tok has been trying to talk about mitigating this since about I think 2020 is when Trump made his first we should ban Tik Tock proposal and then and they&#39;ve been seriously in discussions since around 2022 was that that was when project Texas happened it started project Texas in 2022 that was the period at which it was saying we can mitigate these problems by teaming up with Oracle which as you all remember was also the company that was going to buy it during the period where it seemed like Trump was going to try to really force a sale yeah so this this I&#39;m starting to feel Vindicated Again by my stance of just not really paying attention to this and assuming that it will be chaotic and then go away uh because all of that came to both kind of nothing and where we are now right like Gabby is is that that&#39;s kind of the runup to how we got to where we are we&#39;ve been at this a long time now yeah we we&#39;ve been out this a long time and basically what the government is saying is like we gave you a million chances you could not do what we wanted and Tik Tok is saying you didn&#39;t give us enough chances actually we gave you this proposal we gave you maps of our offices we gave you all of these things please but the government&#39;s argument is also not that Tik Tok has done anything at the behest of the Chinese government just like maybe one day it could so well and that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s been so complicated about this whole thing right like add of you and I have talked about this before it&#39;s that it is this uh impossible to prove and impossible to disprove thing that it&#39;s like it it seems possible that something very bad could happen and and that has gone back and forth a million different times and it does feel like we&#39;re we&#39;re running at the question of like how how legally defensible is the idea that something bad could possibly happen in this case a lot of which I think just depends on how threatening do we think China is because yeah as long as a Chinese company owns Tik Tok like no matter how much they Silo it there&#39;s just I think not technically anything you can do to prove that the company that owns your subsid could not at some point access your data right yeah and so the sense I got just reading the the coverage we did of the hearing was that it it kind of landed in that same place Gabby that like it&#39;s just everybody making the same arguments that all kind of talk past each other and it it doesn&#39;t sound like we&#39;re in a place where there are all that many arguments that actually address each other because one side is like it could be bad and the other side is like well it&#39;s not bad and the other side&#39;s like well it could be and I I don&#39;t know how you overcome that yeah exactly and also I would say the the judges role in this is really interesting at one point one of the judges said that Tik Tok was owned by China and then Tik tok&#39;s lawyer had to be like no no no no we&#39;re owned by a company that has a holding company I think he said in the Cayman Islands he&#39;s like we are not owned by China and you know that&#39;s true the Chinese government does not own Tik Tok but the doj&#39;s entire argument is you know they could influence it they could have they we don&#39;t know probably not maybe but they could um and in my opinion I don&#39;t know what you think Addie but it seemed like the the judges were kind of buying that argument like they were really focused on the National Security risk of the whole thing and the hearing I think wasn&#39;t even so much directed at exactly how much of a threat is Tik Tok it was directed at if Congress thinks there&#39;s a threat can you legally force a company to divest it&#39;s not even like the question of whether it&#39;s a threat I think comes after all of that right I guess that&#39;s true we&#39;re we&#39;re there is kind of a meta aspect of this where we&#39;re we&#39;re not actually arguing about in this particular case I think I think I have this right that whether or not the allegations about Tik Tok are are true it&#39;s the question of if Congress believes the allegations against Tik Tok what is it able to do about them right which feels sort of one step removed from the actual impossible question but is ultimately at this moment maybe the only part of the question that actually matters in terms of what happens to Tik Tok right and I think our caveat like are we at active war with China like I think that those are just really gigantic mitigating factors like exactly how much of a threat do we think China is just as a legal status um but yeah a bunch of this is really just can you prevent something that is a foreign government that we think that Congress thinks presents a threat from operating inside the United States as a commercial entity so Gabby you you were saying it felt like the judges were were buying the argument what was kind of the vibe at the end of the hearing what were you thinking about how it went down it was very unclear to me what would happen but based on the questioning I felt like the judges were both like torn between whether National Security concerns kind of trump this first amendment question but also like they did seem to genuinely be like well if China is a threat and if Congress believes that China is a threat then we have to take that seriously whereas Tik tok&#39;s entire argument was not only are we not owned by China we are not a threat and at one point they were like other companies and platforms based in China are not being singled out in this way so why are we being singled out in this way um which I do think is you know an interesting question well and it seems like with some hindsight now the answer to that question is still a very mysterious but B has something to do with Israel and Hamas and what happened last October and I feel like I I got on this podcast and got very loudly upset about like if you think there is something going on here as the government you have a responsibility to tell us what&#39;s going on uh and as at least as far as I&#39;ve seen we haven&#39;t gotten any of that but do we have any kind of new information or understanding about what is the root cause of all of this why everybody is so mad at Tik Tok and not mad at these other platforms like you&#39;re talking about I think that Israel and Hamas is part of it I don&#39;t think as far as I&#39;m aware Congress has not proved that there has been any kind of influence campaign but there have been several members of Congress um both in the house and the Senate who have said that you know the campus protests for example show that our youth are being influenced by malign foreign actors um that they could not have possibly come to these opinions on their own and that there&#39;s somebody putting this information in front of them in one of the Declarations that was filed by the government there was mention of um a feature on Tik tok&#39;s back end called heating which is when you can kind of just boost certain content um if it&#39;s trending or if you want it to be trending and again it was said like we don&#39;t have any proof that this has been used maliciously but could have been right yeah I the the biggest thing I remember is there was this moment I think it was last fall maybe early this year I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve lost track of time uh where there was a there was an intellig briefing and a bunch of Congress people came out and voted unanimously to ban Tik Tok and and the overwhelming question has been like what did they learn in that briefing and it still feels like whatever it was we don&#39;t know and at this point it it&#39;s almost shocking to me that we don&#39;t know yeah and if you look at the filings like big chunks of it are redacted and I guess you know if there&#39;s valid National Security concerns I do get that but it&#39;s also like what what&#39;s in there what did they tell you right and especially like it&#39;s if there are sort of ongoing actual National Security concerns sure but if it&#39;s like heating is a feature that exists like maybe maybe unreact that like it&#39;s fine let us let us know what&#39;s going on here well that part was was unredacted I mean let me pull up the filing there was one part that I remember being finding very interesting please right okay so there&#39;s a section in one of the filings um8 pages long titled bite dance and Tik tok&#39;s history of censorship and content manipulation at PRC discretion almost entirely redacted what is that history I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s in there maybe and the fact that it&#39;s redacted makes it sound like there must be there must be something so in that same declaration it&#39;s from Casey Blackburn who&#39;s an assistant director of National Intelligence he writes that there is quote no information end quote that the Chinese government has used Tik Tok for quote malign foreign influence targeting us persons or the collection of sensitive data of us persons just the a risk of it happening in the future right and yet we&#39;re being very secretive about all the stuff that&#39;s being discussed I I just I cannot Square those two things in my head Addie can you square those two things this fact that there is a lot of stuff being redacted we&#39;re having this big semi-private sort of obscure debate about what&#39;s going on and then even the people in Congress are saying there&#39;s no evidence that this stuff has been going on how do you make sense of those two things happening simultaneously I don&#39;t know I mean part of the question is how sensitive are the things that are actually redacted I mean there&#39;s we understand that there&#39;s a very very long history of sort of over redaction and over classification in the US government and so it&#39;s plausible that these things like they are sensitive but they are also not necessarily incredibly Divergent from the things we&#39;ve heard publicly but on the other hand I I don&#39;t know I mean I think the question really comes down to something that is still just not related to that which is what is the First Amendment right that you have to operate something as a company that has has a foreign owner right yeah uh so I we should pivot away from this but what what is the next piece of this because we&#39;re still we&#39;re like barreling towards January which is theoretically the deadline for Tik Tok to either be sold or banned depending on who you are and how you read what&#39;s going on here is there a is there a Next Step between here and there that we know is coming the next step is whether the DC Circuit Court decides that it should block this law basically and and then at that point Tik Tok I think correct has until January to at least start the process of getting divested okay this is like definitely going to the Supreme Court right that feels like the inevitable end of this process one way or another yes yeah okay all right cool just checking so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be back we&#39;re going to have many more bites at this particular story uh now I want to talk about the the story that I just don&#39;t understand and and basically didn&#39;t pay any attention to but Gabby you in particular had to and I just feel like I feel like we we owe it to you to let you talk about your feelings about this uh tell me about the Trump space from from last week oh my God so the way I&#39;ve described it to Addie numerous times is like a um jigsaw torture scenario designed for me specifically um it was you know so let&#39;s rewind a little bit Trump was the headliner at the Bitcoin conference this year he&#39;s been really trying to you know show the crypto community that he&#39;s behind them he wants their votes etc etc and his sons and him have been teasing this crypto platform uh World Liberty financial and he was supposed to announce it in a Twitter space at 8:00 pm Eastern so you know I logged on to the Twitter space at like maybe 7:55 Addie was there too I didn&#39;t suffer Alone um and I from 8:00 pm Eastern until what like 10:30 it was about 10:30 it was about 10:30 nobody announced actually what it was um but they started talking about like some of the details but they never said just what it was and I was doing my prewrite like for it and I was taking notes but my it was just like Trump announces TK and then he got off the stream so I had to change the whole thing he didn&#39;t announce anything he was talking about how good his granddaughter Arabella is speaking CH Chinese he was like she impressed she so much he loved her he loved how she spoke and I was like what is this crypto platform please the best way that I had to describe it is like imagine an Apple event or like a game announce at E3 and Steve Job comes up and he&#39;s like I&#39;m announcing something and then he doesn&#39;t actually announce the iPhone and they just start all talking about the iPhone like like features of the iPhone he&#39;s just like here&#39;s how you cut and paste and you&#39;re like on what exactly that&#39;s very good so okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s do some work for this Twitter space what what do we think this thing is to be honest I&#39;m I&#39;m less curious about the product itself and more about sort of what it means in this like political moment in the United States but we should attempt to you know Define the thing a little bit so what what is this thing that they kind of sort of almost didn&#39;t a little bit launch so still actually unclear um three people with knowledge of the project told the New York Times that it has been p as a borrowing and lending platform so to be clear they did not tell the New York Times that it is a borrowing and lending platform they said that it has been pitched as a borrowing and lending platform I I like that distinction because maybe it&#39;s not even that I don&#39;t know may maybe it is but the thing that all of them kept talking about less so Trump because he was just talking about you know his usual stuff um but Donald Trump Jr um some of his business partners they talking about debanked people and underserved communities and um how this is really going to help out a lot of vulnerable people who have been shut out of traditional financial markets and as Addie pointed out when I first wrote about this she was like remember Trump University remember that so Trump University was if I remember correctly um it was before Trump ran for president it was you know his Apprentice times it was a course program where you could learn to be a real estate investor um but then there was a trial because a bunch of people sued him over how the point of trump University was not to teach people to invest in real estate it was to sell them more courses about investing in real estate and other business activities so it was like it&#39;s basically a scam it was basically a scam targeted at people who who would like to get rich like Donald Trump okay and then Addie what did you make of all this so the actual detail that we have based on the stream is that a it is supposed to not an exact quote but a paraphrase Drive Mass adoption of stable coins and be easier to use for normal people um stable coins of course being like coins that are pegged to an actual an actual currency and it is pitched specifically so there is unbanked people there are unbanked people those are people who do not have a bank account they tend to be people who do not have very much money it is a genuine issue and those are folks that the crypto Community has been talking about forever that is like if you want to make like a big beautiful good for the world case for crypto those are the folks that everybody starts with and it&#39;s mostly that&#39;s been tested overseas and the results have been somewhat mixed this is more specifically they pitched to debanked people which is basically people that have been quote unquote cancelled and they lost their bank account because of it which is like let&#39;s just say a much more Niche group yeah I I feel bad laughing when you say that I just assumed that debanked and unbanked were like synonyms for the same thing it is deeply upsetting that that&#39;s not the case oh no no there was a really great quote from Donald Trump Jr who was like you know there was a time where the trumps we could have picked up the phone we could have gotten any CEO of any bank and gotten a loan from anyone in the world on any project and then we got into the political Arena and then he said we went from being people who would have been the elite in that world to just being like totally can sold and it&#39;s like well you also your dad got sued for fraud so so maybe it&#39;s that I don&#39;t know this just it seems like it fits really well into the sort of alt Tech ecosystem stuff like the freedom phone and like various alternative social networks things that V that run from like they actually exist as products to being basically scams or rebadged Android phones yeah I mean and I think the the reason I&#39;m interested in this is is less about the actual product itself and and more about a that ecosystem which is real and growing and there are a lot of people making a lot of money from that ecosystem some of the real products and some of the scams but also the fact that so much of what the tech industry has been talking about with respect to this election has been either explicitly or implicitly about crypto like in in a very real way there is like a dividing line in this election it has to do with how you feel about crypto which I think in a lot of ways has to do with how much money you have invested in crypto uh and and my read of this whole thing was it was just this entire project is just another way for Trump and the Trump campaign to say we love crypto am I is that am I misreading that or understating what they&#39;re actually trying to do here I think that&#39;s part of it but I think another big part of it is that they&#39;re really appealing to the victim complex that a lot of people who are really into crypto have when I was at the Bitcoin conference there were all these people talking about how terrified they are of like Central Bank digital currencies and how you know eventually the Deep state will just be able to like completely shut out whoever they want out of the financial system and that&#39;s why crypto is so powerful it was it was an extremely political or politicized environment at the Bitcoin conference this year it wasn&#39;t just Trump I mean Cynthia lumus spoke Edward Snowden eventually gave a speech that was like yeah all these politicians are making promises to you but maybe maybe I don&#39;t trust him and it was really funny cuz he got a standing ovation before he spoke and then he was like I can&#39;t see you guys I&#39;m like like web calling in right now but thanks and then he didn&#39;t get a standing ovation afterwards and I remember talking to a friend and being like do you think that&#39;s because of what he said or because he they know that he can&#39;t see them and she was like definitely both like but probably more what he said cuz he really like threw cold water on the whole thing he was like maybe it&#39;s not great that there&#39;s a bunch of politicians here maybe that&#39;s bad yeah I I mean it is like the the whatever last five years of the crypto movement I think if you asked people not that long ago how it would feel to have a bunch of politicians be the biggest names in crypto uh they would feel very differently than they seem to today I think that has that has changed in a pretty big way even just over the course of this election cycle um all right no more crypto let&#39;s just talk adtech in other deeply exciting things uh I just want to check in on this this trial Lauren finer on our team has been in the courtroom I think is probably in the courtroom right now as we&#39;re doing not in the courtroom today because she is uh traveling okay that&#39;s good poor Lauren I was there for one day and I had to sit in the courtroom there are no devices no electronics allowed I couldn&#39;t even wear an Apple Watch like nothing and I had to sit there with a notebook and a pen like it was like the 1700s uh and listen to people talk about header bidding and yield management and it was it was really something special uh but Addie you you&#39;ve been editing and assigning a lot of this coverage Lauren&#39;s been in the courtroom a ton I&#39;ve been in the courtroom a little uh it feels like we&#39;re in we&#39;re getting to kind of the the end of the government&#39;s part of this trial what&#39;s your what&#39;s your sense on where we&#39;re going and what we&#39;ve learned so far correct the doj wrapped up yesterday we&#39;re expecting Google to be making its case through mid next week it seems like we could have a wrap of this part of the trial at it&#39;s not a sure thing yet but the end of next week okay and so far it&#39;s hard to say what the judge how the judge is feeling that&#39;s always very hard to say and I think we haven&#39;t gotten a really clear picture in this case but so far the doj&#39;s case is basically Google has incredible power which I think most people don&#39;t dispute and has gotten it by making all these very hard noes decisions that consolidate its power in a way that relies on the fact that it has access to all these different parts of the spectrum it has what was at the time of most of these events double click for Publishers which was Google&#39;s publisher ad sales server and then it has access to the sort of other side of the equation for advertisers and then it has addex which sits in the middle of this and a lot of what ended up coming up is the idea that it used addex access and access to all of this very high quality data about the advertisers to Strongarm Publishers into taking deals that they didn&#39;t really like and into neutering projects that and features that might help people diversify away from Google&#39;s tools it&#39;s it&#39;s been really interesting to follow this trial after covering the search trial a bunch last year because so much of the overarching case here kind of Rhymes right in the sense that Google is like yes we&#39;re very big and we&#39;re very successful like correct we we won we did it good job us but it&#39;s because we&#39;re good at it and because our product is the best and because people like to use it and the government is making almost the exact argument they made back then which is like no you got big because you were good everybody like yes granted congratulations you you did it uh and then you spent years or decades just ruthlessly preventing anyone else from ever being able to do the thing that you did and like the the specifics and the details in the tech are so different but it the case is just the same Google is like we win because we&#39;re good and the government is like well you&#39;re not actually that good anymore but you keep winning so what&#39;s that about right which is how they demonstrate the idea of harm which is that yeah Google made all of these products that people thought were really good and then they created a situation in which the doj alleges the market stagnated right and that it&#39;s a little bit harder because obviously anybody can use search you can look at search you can decide for yourself whether you think search is still good or not in this case it&#39;s a little more indirect but a lot of the idea is people ended up paying more for ads it was harder to run a business that was ad supported it ended up making say ads may be more intrusive because you have to just Spam people with a bunch more um and so there&#39;s the doj isn&#39;t making that case nearly as much but for the average person that is sort of more of the takeaway yeah it it is uh deeply deeply wonky in every possible way and even talking to folks like in the adte business about all of this their eyes kind of start to glaze over when you talk about like the the actual underpinning technology of all of this where it&#39;s like oh let&#39;s talk about publishing servers and the lockin effect that they give for the rest of the and everybody just like falls asleep at their desk talking to me on Google meet uh which I was I was very impressed with the judge in particular the one day I was in court in her ability to just stay locked in she was asking a lot of like vocabulary questions because everything in this entire case is just insane acronyms that no person should know but everyone in the room just assumes you know because they all do it for a living and so at one point she was just like sorry what&#39;s what&#39;s torso and tail in adte she just like paused the whole trial she&#39;s like what does that mean why aren&#39;t you explaining this to me it was great uh it turns out it means uh medium and small Publishers the head is the big ones the me the Torso is the midsize Publishers and the tail is all the like cooking blogs and single person operations that are less the focus of this trial I thought torso was an acronym I&#39;m so sorry to interrupt this um learned conversation but I thought you were going to be like I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t even think of the letters that torso would be but I did think acony return sick open openness yeah that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s you&#39;re right that&#39;s one of Google&#39;s products not a lot of people know about it um but no and I I think I I think you&#39;re kind of right Addie that it seems like it has been really hard to figure out how any of this is going for folks like reading our coverage reading other coverage the government seems to be making making a case Google seems to have strong thoughts about every part of that case and then the strangest part is it like the search trial it&#39;s just down to this one judge who is just sitting there kind of quietly listening and asking vocabulary questions what&#39;s going to happen and I think uh it would be so interesting if this was a jury trial and Google obviously wrote a big check to make this not a jury trial uh but it does feel like it would be different if it was in front of 12 random people off the street instead of one judge yeah so far I think the clearest thing and the thing that seems most likely to go badly for Google is the same thing that was an issue in the search trial about Google over classifying and not storing chats and turning off chat history and things like that it seems not necessarily clear that&#39;s going to play in hugely into this trial in the way that it didn&#39;t last time but certainly seems like something where the judge is not incredibly sympathetic yeah Google keeps doing the thing where they&#39;re like oh let&#39;s talk about this then somebody goes oh chat history is on and then it&#39;s like end of chat like oh well that&#39;s not incriminating at all like that&#39;s that&#39;s cool which is like it&#39;s not necessarily incriminating like obviously but in the last trial there was a bunch of okay you&#39;re just saying things that I understand they&#39;re not necessarily incriminating but they also kind of make you sound bad right exactly make you sound really mocky of Ellen yeah there&#39;s something about saying nobody listen to this that just kind of makes it seem like you&#39;re about to say something you don&#39;t want people to hear like it&#39;s hard to it&#39;s hard to argue with that and even the stuff when they weren&#39;t doing that it was like okay well maybe we should be clear that we use we shouldn&#39;t use this terminology because that would make us sound like a monopoly my I am not a monopoly shirt is raising a lot of questions already answered by my shirt yeah that&#39;s I&#39;m gonna do you think they&#39;d let me wear that shirt into the courtroom I&#39;m going to go I&#39;m going to make that shirt and see if they&#39;ll allow me into the courthouse in Alexandria and see and I will report back it&#39;s going to be great all right we got to take a break I should let you guys go but uh I think it&#39;s it&#39;s about to be an election and and we&#39;re going to have to have you both back and we got some more stuff to talk about between now and then but thank you both oh God that is happening yeah all right we got to take one more break and then we&#39;re going to do a question from the vergecast hotline we&#39;ll be right [Music] back all right we&#39;re back let&#39;s get to the hotline as always the number is 866 Verge one1 the email is vergecast atth verge.com we love hearing all of your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show every week thank thank you by the way to everybody who sent iPhone questions that was super fun to do with Nei and Joanna last week I hope you keep them coming as you get your iPhones and try the new stuff I want to hear what you&#39;re thinking hit us up tell me everything this week we have a question that is near and dear to my organizational Heart s hey my name&#39;s Erica I&#39;m reaching out with kind of a random question you just went through your Min series on productivity but the place I don&#39;t find myself to be super productive is my digital de I have so many documents and so many photos and anytime I try to clean them up it just feels so tedious and I&#39;m sitting on the plane and I&#39;m deleting the screenshots and like is this really the best P of my time so if you guys have any ideas or anything you could think up I would love it thanks guys bye all right so I bring this question to you for a couple of reasons one because if there is a perfect answer to this question I have not found it uh the the idea of digital life being about just collections of stuff is super duper real and uh bad so if if there is a perfect solution if you&#39;ve devised a way to a not let your computer get super cluttered or B clean it up really quickly let me know I want to know I have this newsletter called installer I will I will talk about it there I&#39;ll talk about it here I will sing your name from the rooftops tell me everything but I do have a bit of a system for this and just figured I would share the way that I do it in the hopes that it might help it&#39;s kind of three separate things the first step is about your camera roll on your phone which I think for a lot of people is where a lot of the file clutter exists you take screenshots you have pictures of your receipts you have duplicate pictures of your kids and everything I do two things here the first thing is on both the iPhone and Android there is a way to quickly delete duplicates on your phone which I highly recommend and think everybody should do it&#39;s just in settings in the in the photos app of both of those things you can just delete a duplicates the other one is you can sort out screenshots you can do it in Google photos you just search for screenshots it&#39;ll find the screenshots Apple pulls it all into a separate album I periodically just go in there and delete them all uh I have never once been burned by this where I&#39;m like oh I wish I had that screenshot again go with God I suppose there might be problems if you do it in such a sort of brute forcey way but that is a thing I do every few months and I&#39;m always amazed at how many screenshots I have in there and how few of them I actually care about most of them are just like my lock screen anyway the other one is to find an app that essentially lets you like Tinder swipe your way through your photos there are a bunch of these there&#39;s one called swipe and delete there&#39;s one called swipe wipe there&#39;s one I think called slide box there&#39;s a bunch of these out there most of them will make you pay an ongoing subscription but what I usually do is either just do the free trial or just pay like once and use it once and essentially what they do is they show you a photo and you swipe right to keep it or left to get rid of it and it is shocking how quick a way that is to go through some of your photos most of them it&#39;s it&#39;s a obvious snap decision right keep or lose and having just a mechanism that lets you choose that is great so that&#39;s the first thing camera roll thing number two is your computer and this is where my system is not great but it really works for me so I figured I would share the first thing I do is use an app on the map Mac called disk inventory X and on Windows called windat w n d i r s a t and what both of those do is just visualize the storage on your computer they&#39;ll show you where all the big files are where all the folders are with all the big files and I&#39;ll just go in and find the biggest stuff that I don&#39;t need a lot of it for me is like video recordings or huge application files that I download caches from browsers and just delete all of that and most of the reason I think to do a decluttering like this is because you&#39;re starting to run out of storage and that is a super duper efficient way to do it um again I think for a lot of people photos are a thing that takes up a lot of space so if you have photos elsewhere you can delete them from your computer and free up a lot of space so yeah one of those visualization apps is an incredibly useful way to just figure out where your storage is going and start to get some of it back the second thing I do is once every 6 months or so I will just take all of the contents of my downloads folder and my desktop folder and for me my documents folder uh and just put it all on an external hard drive uh again I&#39;ve deleted the biggest files by now so most of what&#39;s left is like little things I downloaded and documents I made and whatever but the way I work at least anything that I&#39;m going to need permanently ends up somewhere else usually it&#39;s in Google Drive but sometimes it&#39;ll get filed to like a specific spot on my computer anything that is in sort of those like stock folders is probably something I don&#39;t need again but I don&#39;t want to do the work of going through and actually figuring it all out but I also don&#39;t want to delete all of it in case there is something that I need so I have a little tiny two terab hard drive that just sits here on my desk and every few months I plug it in I empty the folders onto that drive and then I don&#39;t think about it again uh it cleans up my computer it makes everything very simple and if all of a sudden I&#39;m like oh where is that thing it&#39;s on the hard drive overwhelmingly it is on the hard drive uh that has been incredibly useful for me in both keeping my computer and me sane but also not having to dedicate like four full days a year to keeping it that way so that&#39;s my system it has worked very well for me I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the best system I also am like relatively organized otherwise so again like things that I know where I&#39;m going to need end up mostly getting filed somewhere so if you&#39;re just kind of a like let chaos rain and then once a month tame it person you should probably keep doing that system rather than mine but I just wanted to share in case that helps start with the camera roll get rid of the big files dump everything else onto a hard drive and know that it&#39;s there if you need it I hope that helps that&#39;s all I got and if you have a better idea I would love to hear it I think this is a problem everybody has I&#39;m looking at like the mass of icons on my desktop right now and I&#39;m like I need to do this again and I think a lot of us do so I&#39;d love to hear from you anyway for now that is it for the Verge cast thank you to everybody who came on the show and thank you as always for

The lights on the back panel and the glyph notifications aren\u2019t a total gimmick, though they\u2019re more of a fashion statement than anything.

It also comes with a higher price tag \u2014 it starts at $1,199, $200 more than the model that preceded it, and a model with a decent amount of storage runs $1,499 or more.

      "description": "When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the \u201cbest camera\u201d in a smartphone. But a few weeks later, Google\u2019s Pixel 6 Pro, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s 12-megapixel camera. To settle the score I took 1,000 photos with each device and realized using these cameras was about far more than their end products.\n\niPhone 13 Pro gallery: https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ\nPixel 6 Pro gallery: https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:31 Camera Specs\n01:09 Telephoto lenses\n02:20 Ultra-wide lenses\n04:05 Main lens\n05:58 Hardware + Software\n09:09 Google's Real Tone Feature\n10:20 Video\n11:46 Poll Results\n12:49 Conclusion\n\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/G5RXGs\u200b\nLike The Verge on Facebook: https://goo.gl/2P1aGc\u200b\nFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/XTWX61\u200b\nFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/7ZeLvX\u200b\n\nThe Vergecast Podcast: http://apple.co/3kH4uup\nDecoder with Nilay Pate\u202al\u202c: http://apple.co/3v29nDc \nMore about our podcasts: https://www.theverge.com/podcasts\u200b\n\nRead More: http://www.theverge.com\u200b\nCommunity guidelines: http://bit.ly/2D0hlAv\u200b\nWallpapers from The Verge: https://bit.ly/2xQXYJr\u200b\n\nSubscribe to Verge Science on YouTube, a new home base for our explorations into the future of science: http://bit.ly/2FqJZMl",
