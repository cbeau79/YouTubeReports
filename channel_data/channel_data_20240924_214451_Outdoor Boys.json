my buddy Sam is from cot this is his parents house and uh he&#39;s a rock star cuz everyone&#39;s excited to see them right yeah we brought food we got some uh ribe eyes they&#39;re still pretty Frozen but we&#39;ll Tha them out real quick you guys teaching so much she called what can we do to help you in bath had to S we got a wedge of Bree cheese and this is garlic and honey and it&#39;s just kind of all melted and warm yeah so so how do you do he loves sea oil yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m cooking dinner and word has gotten out that there&#39;s a YouTuber in town I got to say hi to the K what&#39;s up I think we got a we got a bit of a crowd going here was that W we&#39;re going to try to catch a seal you think we should catch a seal yeah I think we should catch a moose [Applause] well I got to go ahead and cook dinner but we&#39;re going to be around that crowd&#39;s getting bigger not smaller out there boy right there you go there&#39;s some couscous oh these are the Nick sticks right no what do you call them in UPI so these are for the catching the Cisco through the ice mhm when when&#39;s not working can use the other you switch over is that a bone there no land all right should we go catch some moose we should all right let&#39;s do it all right guns are out here difference difference is the modern day cartridg is hi what kind gun you got 7 mm of Mag so we&#39;ve got a lot of things we want to do on this trip including getting a moose I because you guys like wild meat right people here in the native community in Alaska they grow up on wild food and that&#39;s what they like and when they get sick and need medical treatment they go to Anchorage to the native hospital so what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re going to go hunt a moose and donate to the native hospital so they can feed their patients some traditional wild food Luke you want a earbuds rifle oh really yeah so here in cottick they hunt a lot of seals and Sam&#39;s family uses atlal to hunt them there some cool stuff that that tips made out of a bone no it&#39;s brass brass got little brass Barb right there this is a type of spear called an at latle in yup it&#39;s uh what was it nuk nuk the spear in the at latle is not for killing the seal it&#39;s for sticking the Barb in the seal so you can see where it&#39;s going when it goes underwater the boat can then follow the floating Spear and get up to the seal and Harpoon it that&#39;s the Harpoon right there this is just the tracking device all right c a serious distance oh the spears are designed to float out of the water like this so you can grab them without getting your hands wet keeps your hands from going numb it&#39;s pretty good seal meat seal blubber seal oil are a very important part of the traditional diet so we&#39;re definitely going to keep our eye out for seal and if we see one that Seal&#39;s in trouble a rhythm oh I can see him there a moose looks like there&#39;s a young Bow right [Music] there there too much water you&#39;ve got to really think it through before you pull the trigger on these Mose they can weigh 1,500 lb or more and you got to haul all that meat piece by piece back to this boat and there&#39;s a lot of swamp right here we&#39;d have to walk through we&#39;d have to haul all that meat through the swamp well legally we allowed to shoot Bulls or CS but we prefer to shoot Bulls because that has less impact on the overall population we&#39;re going to go ahead and keep looking there&#39;s a moose right there a c oh we just saw another moose but it&#39;s a calf so we&#39;re not going to shoot it was he went that way should be right around there if he kept going you just saw a third moose right over there but it ran into the bushes we just saw our fourth moose but we let it go it was standing in swampy ground and trying to chop it up into pieces while it&#39;s under the water or in the mud is just a mess shooting a moose in the right place is just as important as shooting the right Moose for moose in like 45 minutes yeah it&#39;s a lot of moose around here there&#39;s so many moose here that the limit is three per person this is where our moose laid down there&#39;s a big bull over there with a huge set of antlers and it just saw and ran off but there&#39;s another cow over there and she&#39;s sitting in the water up to her neck we&#39;ve already seen six moves hey hey Dan just saw another moose that&#39;s number seven just walking down there and see stay down stay down [Music] you just saw two moose and one of them&#39;s a b oh that&#39;s a hit how&#39;s it hit [Music] down you just saw a big bull come across the river come up onto the bank that that is a big animal wow look at I mean of that that is a big animal Tim could be closer but it could also be a lot worse you gut the deer on the I got more than a sneaky feeling that that was the easiest part of the whole process yep yep moose are like deer they lose their antlers every year and while they&#39;re growing they&#39;re covered in this velvet this fur and then right about this time of year they start to drop off the Velvet peels off and the Bones Exposed we got dig PR holy mael that is a big animal there we go this is actually the first moose I&#39;ve ever harvested and uh it&#39;s going to be a lot of meat it&#39;s kind of a typical one would you say yeah yeah this is not a monster by any stretch of the imagination but we&#39;re not here for trophies we&#39;re here to get a meat and this has got plenty of that we got a lot of work ahead of us we got to chop this thing up and we got to be real careful to keep all the meat good as I film this I&#39;ll try to keep the blood and guts to a minimum okay the closest I&#39;ve ever come to gutting a moose is holding the garbage bag for all the men when I was a teenager so uh I am unskilled labor here we&#39;re going to defer to the elders you want me to hold the leg up while you do that we take the skin off the top of the mousse and use that as a tarp so that you can flip the mousse over not work in the mud so these right here are game bags they protects the meat and lets it breathe so it doesn&#39;t rot that just this one front leg joint weighs about 90 lb all that weight on your back really makes you sink down in the mud more there with him get this done just in time how you feeling Luke yeah pretty good we got the entire moose in the boat except for the guts and the skin taking us 10 loads and two hours that was a lot of work we got a boat full of moose and not a moment too soon just saw the sunet like I said shooting them&#39;s the easy part this is cool thank you C you see this us 5 hours to find shoot gut and get a moose back up here I was in it got me rushed the back the ribs are in the other back tension on it got that hung up we&#39;ll just let it cool down and we can deal with it some more tomorrow it&#39;s only about 40\u00b0 out right now so it&#39;s uh not that much difference from a refrigerator out here oh my goodness I think my pants got a little uh gross I smell like moose look better you feel better some pie around the kitchen table seems like a great way to end a moose hunt I anyone&#39;s called dibs on it all right guys it is late I got to put the camera up we&#39;ll see you in the morning good morning morning like my foot touched the leg we&#39;re going to head out and look for seals and do a little bit of fishing so we&#39;re going to head to the local store see if we can buy a few fishing [Music] lures there&#39;s no restaurants in town right no and uh no hotels either no hotels NOP that&#39;s one of the things is you can&#39;t just come and visit these communities you have to be a guest cuz there&#39;s nowhere for you to stay there&#39;s nowhere for you to eat oh you got a spinner yep just one huh just one just one you have a good day oh yeah yeah those look front of the boat there&#39;s a moose running in the water and he&#39;s doing this we bring one extra before we can go fishing and seal hunting we got to go get that moose head out theat are you guys measuring the Moose antlers yeah we&#39;re trying and a half 49 and 12 Ines I&#39;ll go with that oh that&#39;s not bad it&#39;s uh AC it&#39;s a leov so we&#39;re in the ocean now we&#39; gone up this River we&#39;re going to go ahead and set a giln net for a fish called The Cisco oh they just I think one just jumped right there where it&#39;s so got the little buoy right there and the net anchored to the bank while we let the net soak we&#39;ll try catching a few on rod and reel oh yeah there&#39;s some right there in that Cove I right there bu hey hey hold there you go nice little Cisco little Starry flounder I we go swimming up here we&#39;re watching just hundreds of these little fish jump right there and we&#39;re thinking we better pull the that quickly before we get too many fish and yes that can be a problem yeah look right there oh yeah I can see some in there already oh there&#39;s two there I think it&#39;s good we didn&#39;t leave it for a long time look at that that&#39;s a big one there oh that&#39;s a white fish that&#39;s a yeah a Broadhead white fish right here all right we&#39;re going to throw it back there&#39;s one more so that right there is a fish called The Cisco that&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming for I ain&#39;t going nowhere y looks like about 11 cisos and about 15 20 minutes going to take a quick look the Boose some smoke salmon shipwreck of an old steam dredge you got one little tiny guy oh my goodness this a little baby she fish this is a tiny guy they get up to 60 lb oh there&#39;s a grizzly bear right there oh yeah it&#39;s hot yeah man those things move quick came around the corner there&#39;s a grizzly bear on the bank and he just took off running legs I think they might have been running across the river to get away from that grizzly bear that shallow oh nice Jim&#39;s got one right there that&#39;s a little bit more of a proper Shea fish right there one of the largest members of the white fish family live out in the ocean they come into the rivers to feed great fish I like Shea fish a lot they&#39;re good eating fish same Rod oh nice oh jeez there you go yeah he inhaled that so deep I look at that that is nice that is a proper she fish right there well Sam I&#39;m taking pictures with your fish man that&#39;s cool oh nice I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a St looks like a salmon yeah that is a salmon that&#39;s a oh nice oh yeah that&#39;s running like a silver oh oh oh he oh

make some lunch see is how we got some fresh fish nice nice there you go look at that beautiful silver salmon see the scar on him that&#39;s from a sealed spright out that way okay let that one go your call I said we let it go okay cool I love catching Shea fish pretty excellent beaching there see other one of them got double good look at that oh that smells good oh look at that we got some cooked onion all right we&#39;re going to go up this River a little bit and see what else we can find oh that&#39;s a live Beaver House see there&#39;s a beaver house those trees in the water there&#39;s this food storage you got to build that food pile up for the winter time silver yeah it&#39;s starting to turn a little bit yeah but he&#39;s per he&#39;s beautiful that&#39;s a beautiful one I know there we go he&#39;s starting to turn his colors well we&#39;re going to head back to cottick and uh keep an eye out for seals on our way I bought this customade ULU knife in Gnome last winter this is a traditional Native Alaskan blade used for processing meat and fish like his knife because he&#39;s using a woman&#39;s not for men&#39;s that&#39;s why she right Sam&#39;s mom was taking a photo of me cuz she&#39;d never seen a man using an ULU before apparently that&#39;s not a thing in this part of Alaska it&#39;s pretty much the subsistence lifestyle in the nutshell right I don&#39;t think people realize how much work it is y on an annual basis like somebody&#39;s living in the village how how much meat do you think they would catch each year how many fit like salmon over 100 per family and they put it away for the whole year and they&#39;d probably get a moose or something on top of that you think yes usually one moose per family but you know if if the salmon is bad and maybe they&#39;ll Harvest two of them yeah and then there&#39;s a lot of other things like the Cisco and the she fish and other things you kind of pick up throughout the year as well too yes it takes a lot to feed a family you know clean you put in the back yeah or the um the Lo this is the leg uh this you like yeah whatever however you can I just need it open so I can well that was my first time processing a mousse and I got it done as much as I dare do out here in cottick the rest I&#39;m going to do at my home or we&#39;re going to do at the hospital oh I just forgot about the antlers and we got to get the tongue out oh yeah oh we&#39;re almost done what do they call it [Music] [Applause] hey got a smoke house full of meat and I got the antlers off well everyone&#39;s worked up an appetite and uh they said they would like me to make some bread so I&#39;m going to go ahead and do [Laughter] that days you got to tell people at home that this doesn&#39;t taste as good as it looks tell them the truth it&#39;s pretty good it&#39;s pretty good yeah we&#39;re sitting here talking and they uh showed me this this is the the crop of a tarmigan with all the willow tips inside inflated it like a balloon and dried it like a little rattle entertain the grandbabies spear games oh it&#39;s almost 1 o&#39;clock again you guys are party animals all right I&#39;ll see you guys in the morning hey good morning thank you very much Eastern the far okay we just found out that the plane that&#39;s going to take the Moose out of the village is going to be here in like 20 25 minutes so we&#39;ve got to hurry and get that moose in bins and out to the airport get the bag and they grab the bag they dump it there and I was machine died on them we&#39;re clearing the road all right we right all right that&#39;s a cot Lake traffic jam right there oh there&#39;s our plane it&#39;s an old I&#39;d love to help Dan but I&#39;m filming so I just under luckily it&#39;s a little bit cheaper to fly things out of the village cuz the planes come in unload and then they&#39;re empty on the way out so I think we&#39;re paying about 85 cents a pound to fly it to yonic then it&#39;s going to cost me about 65 Cent to get it a pound to get it from ammonic to Anchorage there goes the plane we got the moose meat on the plane weed to take it easy and give you guys the walking tour of cottick the village of cottick has about 600 people who live here and it&#39;s a traditional upic Village the upic are a type of Eskimo or Arctic people and this is a good representation of the villages we have here in the Yukon River delta you may have noticed that they&#39;ve got this Wood boardwalk and no roads because you look as far as you can see it&#39;s all Marshland any rocks any gravel that you would need to build a road it would have to be shipped in by boat so it&#39;s a lot more cost effective to bring in wood and build these boardwalks you can see here this is like the old Boardwalk here where they would just lay down wood straight on the mud and you notice nobody in town has cars or trucks everyone uses ATVs four-wheelers in the summer and snow machines in the winter you can see this right here these are old snow machine Treads those Treads are here to add tractions cuz in the winter time this Boardwalk gets really icy hi welome thank you I&#39;m having a wonderful time by the way is that a seal Pelt oh good to meet you what&#39;s your name Sean hey Sean oh look at this cutie is this your boy Junior oh Junior hi pleasure to meet you look at this this is a seal skin they got drying you Al you got that with the sphere yeah it takes kind of little ears for some practice of course it does cuz it&#39;s super hardcore you meeting you that is so cool here in Alaska it&#39;s really common for the native people in the villages to live subsistence Lifestyles that means most your food comes from hunting or fishing hey hello people have been so friendly in the village so check it out this right here is a honey bucket collection site so people who don&#39;t have sewer in their house you poo in a bucket with a bag inside and then once it fills up you tie off the bag you bring it out over here to get disposed of there&#39;s still lots of communities here in Alaska that don&#39;t have sewer or water which by the way is what my brother does he&#39;s a civil engineer so he spent most of his career putting sewer and water in villages like this yeah you see this duck work right here that&#39;s the sewer system because there&#39;s no Hills and you can&#39;t bury the sewer system you can&#39;t use a gravity fed sewer system so they have a big vacuum system just like an airplane toilet so this is the school building see they got their playground and the kids can park their bikes and four-wheelers and over there is the teachers housing most of the teachers in these Village Schools come from outside the community and so they need a place to stay because there&#39;s no Apartments Sam told me that the school wanted me to come in and do a little presentation for the kids hey [Applause] guys [Applause] yes I want to hear you hello we have a broadcasting class here so we&#39;re going to go do an interview I&#39;ll put a link in the video description below good 10 to 12 days worth of work to do this one video good job everybody this was our first Film Production thank you hey say byebye Oh What a Beautiful Day oh the freight company just got the moose meat in the Village of aonic and they weighed it&#39;s 567 lb a little bit more than I thought but that&#39;s all right look at that oh we got some beautiful Cisco here shots too I think I&#39;m going to try that all right I&#39;m going to go use the bathroom here all [Applause] right there we go speci was so Chao this morning we forgot to ship the antlers oh well that&#39;s the least important part of the moves today is the day we try hard to harvest a seal in the seat box so we&#39;re out here in the wide open part of the river we&#39;re looking for seals ring seals spotted seals and bearded seals well we&#39;ve been driving around in the boat for about an hour looking for seals we&#39;re going to just stop and pull over and warm up a little bit look at this plant right here I believe this is poisonous water hemlock right here very dangerous thank you get in the boat oh there&#39;s a couple Ducks coming teals oh I love green weed heels heels are good got the blood going got a little salmon in US killed the duck all right time to go this look like spent another couple hours driving around looking for seals taking a little break it&#39;s only about 40\u00b0 and that wind is in your teeth it gets cold pretty good just saw a seal it was sitting on the side and it just went flopped into the water oh there he is there he is the reason why they&#39;re throwing the spears at him rather than shooting them with the rifle is if you shoot with the rifle and kill him he&#39;ll sink to the bottom oh o o it&#39;s like playing whacka bable he&#39;s just going popping up and going down and popping up and if they can get one of the Spears in him it&#39;ll act like a marker and follow him around and then they can know where he&#39;s going to pop up and get him with the Harpoon it&#39;s shallow the spear stuck in the mud there you go yeah oh that was good oh CH oh man over there over there over there this is scar that was F we spent about 40 minutes chasing that seal but he started getting smart and running off gave us a slip another boat from the village just showed up they got two little boys on the boat they&#39;re on the front with their Spears well I think that one got away we&#39;re there he oh There He Is We were 2 seconds away from calling it and going to another spot and there&#39;s the seal third boat from the village just pulled up you guys calling it on this one yeah okay well that Seal&#39;s giving all three boats to slip again we&#39;ve been chasing him for about 2 hours it&#39;s almost 8:00 we&#39;re going to call this one a victory for the seal yeah I never is there I TR some I&#39;ve never had it dried do you peel off the skin no just eat the whole thing that&#39;s dried smelt or dried hooligan seal so this is the oil from a seal from ring seal that&#39;s cool a little bit of salt in it have to get it on your clothing yeah they make the seal oil by taking all the seal fat and putting in a 5 gallon bucket in a cool room and then the oil just separates out of the fat oh what is that uh seal meat it is Seal meat and this is a bearded seal mhm this m look almost they you know I like that it&#39;s weird but it tastes like fresh peanuts have you ever had like green peanuts unroasted peanuts tastes like tastes like green peanuts to me a bearded seal meat is real mild are like that soon as we getting a little closer there aren&#39;t we we&#39;re just driving by and one of the families from the village look like they got a moose Cory yeah Cory I&#39;m Luke nice to meet you I&#39;m yeah my older it was above oh weekend good thing we&#39;re all here to help watch and supervise oh my goodness now

everyone&#39;s looking around for the seal I think he gave them the slip before we showed up up your tricks we never saw the seal but it was an exciting last little harah before we had to get going we got a plane coming in and just a few hours and we need to get back first thing I need to do is get this thing rafted up and shipped just in case we need an extra finished you think that&#39;ll fit in

      "subtitles": "hey Luke here with the udra boys YouTube channel and welcome to the interior of Alaska for the next 3 days I&#39;m fishing hunting camping foraging and eating what I [Music] [Applause] find I&#39;m driving down the highway and there&#39;s a grous on the side of the road all right let&#39;s do this right there whole bunch of them right there didn&#39;t get anything but it&#39;s a good omen it is a cold sloppy day to go camping it&#39;s a high of 50 de right now it&#39;s always supposed to get colder but hopefully the weather will be better tomorrow woo how went flying over oh the ground is so Rocky here it keeps flipping my cart I&#39;m going to go ahead and lay it flat to try to lower the center of gravity hopefully that&#39;ll stop tipping over took me 6 hours to drive here and it&#39;s already 700 p.m. I&#39;ve got about 3 and 1/2 miles to go before I get to where I want to campoo it&#39;s cold out here oh these rocks are killing me I flipped my card or had to adjust my load so many times so far this is really slowing me down well it&#39;s about 900 p.m. and I haven&#39;t eaten dinner yet I made it about 3 and 1/2 miles so I&#39;m pretty darn close to the end of the trail think I need to just go ahead and set up my tent it is late and I am cold and wet this Tundra is so lumpy I got to find a flat spot I think this is about as flat as I&#39;m going to get [Applause] inside of my backpack got a little wet but my uh my sleeping bags dry yeah one of the first things I got to do is dry my gun don&#39;t want it rusting it&#39;s right around freezing I think we got about a 50/50 chance of waking up to snow cold rain like this is the worst I&#39;d rather be in - 20 than cold rain okay I brought a little bag of buali it&#39;s ground up white corn maze and is a staple food over in East Africa ugali tastes really similar to Grits I took one of these lipin chicken noodle soup packets which is pretty much just chicken noodle soup broth and then I added about an ounce of ugali and look at it it&#39;s turned it into a whole thing of porridge I&#39;ve been eating this ugali a lot since our trip to Tanzania last spring and it&#39;s quickly becoming one of my favorite Camp Foods I&#39;m cold wet and tired I&#39;m going to put the camera down and see you guys in the morning oh good morning oh it is cold this is a 15\u00b0 bag and I&#39;ve got all my clothes on inside and I am just barely warm I don&#39;t want to get up but I really have to use the bathroom I brought some thermals to wear under my pants and I forgot them in the car and I&#39;m so regretting it it&#39;s just a few degrees above freezing it&#39;s not raining but I think I&#39;m going to put put my rain gear on Just for warmth I need to walk around to get some warmth up and I need to get some water so I&#39;m going to head over to this River while that&#39;s boiling I&#39;m going to go ahead and start collecting some berries for breakfast see right there those are blueberries right there it&#39;s not a very good year for blueberries this year for whatever reason the blueberry bushes seem to be pretty Barren we got uh tons of these crowberries around here see they grow in these little clumps crowberries are a little bit more inconsistent in their flavor but I like them better all these years of picking up my kids Legos is paid off there we go it&#39;s about a pound of crowberries right there some orange zest herbal tea here we&#39;re going to add some crowberries to it oh that worms my fingers up I&#39;m seeing blueberry bushes all over the place but I&#39;ve only found like two blueberries this Leaf is from a plant called Artic loopin it&#39;s poisonous it&#39;s one of the things you got to be careful with foraging it&#39;s easy to snatch up poisonous plants and run your fingers through it and then see the plants stick to your hands then you wash off your hands leaves stick to your hand the berries roll off all righty it&#39;s looking a lot cleaner you see I&#39;m boiling this and the berries that are right and soft will fall apart quickly and the berries that are not ripe take a lot longer to break down so what ends up happening is the juice in the pot ends up being just from the r berries there we go a big pot of crowberry oatmeal if you&#39;ve never had a crowberry they taste a little bit like a Blackberry in my mind you know how blackberries can e be really good or really bad crowberries can be like that but they&#39;re crunchier now I got some food in me I think I want to do a little exploring see a trail that goes up over these Hills and I just want to see where it goes I&#39;m just so glad it&#39;s not raining anymore definitely keeping my eye out for Tagan I would love to eat some for dinner tonight oh look at all these blueberries oh man this looks like a prime spot for tarmigan so I&#39;m just following game trails and I&#39;m trying to stay on The Ridges because we got all this fog coming in and out I can&#39;t navigate by landmarks I got to be able to find my way back even if the visibility gets really really bad these are low Bush cranberries they&#39;re not a bad Berry but you don&#39;t want to eat them raw they&#39;re best in jams a mouse has been using this to store blueberries there&#39;s a little stash of blueberries underneath it a look the mountains are peeking out maybe we&#39;ll get lucky and it&#39;ll clear up today I want to walk that Ridge along the lake but there&#39;s all that really thick Willows right in there I thinking my Best Bets right in there if you get down in these gullies and the brush gets tall and it&#39;s hard to move you can&#39;t see anything and if there was a bear in here I wouldn&#39;t know it until I stepped on him that&#39;s not good grizzly bears aren&#39;t known for liking surprises here we go let&#39;s get some more elevation you can stay on The Ridges it&#39;s pretty easy hiking the Wolves the Caribou the bear the Moose they all do the same thing that I&#39;m doing they try to go from Ridge to Ridge to Ridge and there&#39;s these little pockets in between The Ridges parking squirrel right there I could shoot him and I could eat him but I&#39;ve done that before I didn&#39;t like it like tough gy buffalo wings I always heard that they call them Parky squirrels because you SE this getting into a parka each fall huge herds of caribou have to migrate through these mountains and this Valley is a choke point there&#39;s very little room on the side of this Lake for the Caribou so hunters will wait here to Ambush the Caribou herds as they come by for thousands of years indigenous Hunters have come here to this Valley to hunt Caribou but because of that there&#39;s lots of archaeological sites around this Valley I just heard a Tagan it was really faint may be coming from that way Tagan make this really distinct cackle noise when they see Predators stop sprinkling the sun&#39;s coming out the weather&#39;s gone from horrible to all right oh I&#39;m GNA get wet try to knock the water off before I go past you walk through the brush and you just get soaked that right there is gridly Bear poo it&#39;s like berries and leaves and fur I think there&#39;s a Marmet or something on top of that rock yeah he was sitting right there on that rock a duck right there duck hutting season doesn&#39;t start for another two weeks moose or Caribou bones right there oh I&#39;m wet I wet my pants oh it&#39;s starting to rain again look up there it&#39;s starting to snow on top of the mountain Alaska we call that termination dust termination of Summer well I spent about 4 and 1 half hours hiking around looking for Tarman and uh that didn&#39;t pan out so I&#39;m going to shift gears and see if we can&#39;t catch some fish going to go Downstream a little bit oh there we go that is a beautiful Arctic grilling look at that all right I got something to eat nice fish that a nice one look at that he&#39;s a little bit too nice like I don&#39;t have the heart to eat that one that guy was about 18 in that&#39;s a huge grailing I&#39;d rather eat two or three normal size ones the best way to catch grilling is with a dry fly but you tend to cast huge ones with spinners there we go oh that&#39;s another another gorgeous grilling oh oh These are Cloud berries you don&#39;t find those in large numbers you only get one Berry per plant they&#39;re kind of a rare treat got a deep Channel there got a little bit of a channel here and we got it where it drops off after these riffles that&#39;s where I want to hit there we go look at that another beautiful grilling I got a soft spot for grailing it&#39;s hard to kill such a beautiful fish there&#39;s grailing jumping everywhere if I had a dry fly I&#39;d be catching a lot more of there we go that&#39;s another beautiful gring nope oh I just lost my lure this is too much fun all my lures are back at the camp gring love to eat dry flies and if you don&#39;t know which dry fly to use use an elar catus there we go look at that oh there we go oh just right there just fiddling with the cavern now that seems like a good eating size one just dozens of these grings rising to flies they two nice grilling right there that&#39;s that&#39;s enough I got enough fish for dinner tonight but I want to catch a few more just for fun oh there we go oh my goodness what a beautiful fish keep thinking about those thermals I left in the car last night my legs are really wet and cold I&#39;m really tempted to take the gun in the bike and do the six mile round trip back to the car to go get my thermals and with this better weather there&#39;s a decent chance I might see a Tagan on the trail too I brought the inflatable pack ra with me just in case I wanted to explore the lake I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen so I&#39;m going to go ahead and strap it to the bike and bring it back to the car make things a lot easier tomorrow well it&#39;s a little bit under 7 mil round trip but without the trailer I should be able to do it pretty quick all righty tell you when the sun comes out like this this Tundra is so beautiful got some bread flour and yeast I&#39;m going to make up some bread dough stick this in the tent let it ferment for a couple hours I brought my little three-eight fly rod along it would be a shame to not bust it out and catch some grilling this thing was made for catching grailing before we go fly fishing I got to gut these fish that should keep the fish cold and keep the birds off it that that trick works most of the time but I have had weasel steal fish before yeah it&#39;s another beautiful one oh look at that oh there right there immediate hit it&#39;s reminds me of fishing with my dad and brother growing up wish they were here right now [Music] jumped clean out of the water like Shamu I fished a lot of places where this would be a really big fish instead it&#39;s like the smallest one here all right there you go there you go another beautiful gring this is fly fishing heaven right here catching big grailing on a dry fly in the middle of a river like this oh I love [Music] this gring are just perfect for fly fishing they live in these shallow little beautiful streams they always love a dry fly and the more you cast to them the more excited they get and you can actually whip them up into a frenzy by casting to them a bunch ooh that was a nice one this little pool is only about a foot and a half deep and there&#39;s probably 20 to 30 grailing right there oh look at he just came right at it oh there he goes there we go right there oh another big one well I&#39;ve completely lost track of how many grailing I caught it&#39;s got to be somewhere around 20 to 30 but the wind&#39;s picked up and I&#39;m getting a little cold and I&#39;m getting a little hungry I&#39;ll tell you what that is just a fun Creek to fish it&#39;s a little past 6:00 I think it&#39;s time to make some dinner gring have really thin little scales kind of like a trout so when you fry them in oil the scales get crispy kind of like potato [Applause] chips got some of our bread dough all right got our crowberries here ain&#39;t fancy we got warm bread melted butter and honey putting some hot crowberries on them and I got crispy grilling gring&#39;s just a real clean white meat very similar to Bluegill now skin is the best part oh that&#39;s hot I&#39;m full we at 7:00 and I&#39;m pretty tired I think I&#39;m going to go and just button up everything and get ready for bed good morning really glad I got my thermal pants on though totally worth the trip we go tell the bread&#39;s fermented nice bread dough will last 3 or 4 days in the bag like this and eventually it just becomes comes sourdough all right got a little bit of the crowberry sauce left there we go little fry bread I&#39;m going to try really hard not to stay in my sleeping bag that&#39;s good that was very good it&#39;s almost exactly the same temperature it was yesterday morning but I am so much warmer having my thermals on my legs made a huge difference and I woke up warm instead of waking up cold not having it raining and having the humidity lower sure helps too this has been a great campsite I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t seen or heard anybody there&#39;s just thousands of places just like this in Alaska the biggest problem is picking where to pull your car over and start walking it&#39;s time to pack up and start heading home it&#39;s going to take me about 7 hours to get home a quick walk around see if I forgot anything I think that&#39;s it and nice clear day early in the morning like this there&#39;s really good chance I&#39;ll see a tag again on the trail I haven&#39;t given up hope oh these rocks make it hard with the trailer I&#39;m okay I think this might be one of those slow as fast fast as slow situations you know it&#39;s actually going better than it did the first time oh you know I think this might be the last trip I have with this coat it&#39;s got a lot of holes in it yeah yeah oh there&#39;s another one every time I take it off I see feathers floating around well guys it&#39;s been fun I&#39;m anxious to go home and see my family all right guys see you next time if you like that video make sure to check out the outdoor Boys YouTube channel where we

      "description": "1 year ago I bought an off grid homestead and cabin that was full of abandoned property. And we have spent the last 4 months working hard on the property to get repairs and projects done before winter. Summer is a busy time in Alaska, so as soon as the snow starts to melt we got to work on our abandoned homestead. We are finishing our new garage to replace the one that was crushed by the snow. Repairing the cabin that caught on fire last summer. Demolishing an old log cabin. Building roads. Working on ATV's and a lot more. 4 months worth of footage from our first full summer at the off grid cabin. \n\nOutdoor Boys on FACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys\n\nOutdoor Boys on INSTAGRAM\n@outdoorboyschannel\n\nBUY OUTDOOR BOYS T-SHIRTS\n http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/",

      "subtitles": "Luke here at the AR Boys YouTube channel and one year ago we bought an abandoned Homestead in the interior of Alaska for the next 4 months we&#39;re going to be working like dogs getting it ready for the winter we&#39;re working on ATVs fixing trucks building roads repairing burned buildings demolishing cabins and we&#39;re bringing you guys along for the [Music] ride last time I was here found out my k truck was leaking engine coolant I&#39;m really going to need this truck this summer if I&#39;m going to get any projects done and uh so I got to get this thing fixed in the meantime I&#39;m going to take my snow dog up to the cabin and store it in my new garage oh there&#39;s a lot of overflow everything&#39;s melting and the water travels under the snow not on top of it you at this it&#39;s breakup season here in Alaska [Applause] the purpose of this trip was to get the K truck fixed but I wasn&#39;t going to waste a trip so I figured I&#39;d bring a bunch of supplies and try to get the stairs built while I&#39;m at it also looks like the excavation for this building is causing some draining issues got water coming down here into the footings I&#39;d like to make that water go off that direction if I could that puts a very small Band-Aid on [Music] it well there we go got that done and just in time too well I am running out of time I got to hurry up and get all that stuff put away there we go that was another big project knocked off my list but I need to go get the K truck loaded up we&#39;ll leave it up to the professionals see what they can do with it I brought the snow machine to run it down the trail but uh I don&#39;t think uh we got any snow left and I&#39;ve got the side by side we could have used but I forgot to bring the keys [Music] it&#39;s only been a week since we were here last the snow has melted so much Tommy I just realized something I did the stairs upside down the stairs are supposed to be right here yeah climb up still work see see how steep they are I was kind of in a hurry and I just I yeah it&#39;s fine hey Tom let&#39;s get the heater going here yeah let&#39;s do I ordered some Chinese takeout in vacuum sealed it and froze it this is sesame chicken uh pot stickers this is a Thai curry warm that up nothing like Chinese takeout on a camp out woohoo I have a chocolate cookie I think bringing the snow machine back was the right call it&#39;s only been a few hours and there&#39;s already a lot less snow on the trail check it out this whole part of the trail is caved in there&#39;s another section of Trail that&#39;s like collapsed into a big sinkhole this clay holds so much water and when it freezes it expands and creates void voids under the ground just chews the trail up look check it out my foot just broke through this Trail I&#39;ll tell you Alaska&#39;s a beautiful place but this time of year it&#39;s kind of a mangy dog I the Box f it just fell and nearly missed my head the box fan fell off yeah ah that was kind of a Jerry rigged piece of garbage anyways all righty Tommy I think it&#39;s time to get ready for bed two of these or do you think one&#39;s I&#39;m going to put the camera up I will see you guys in the morning it&#39;s a sloppy rainy day today all right hop aboard why honey cinnamon toast thank you very much obiously what do you think of that french toast casserole and a breakfast Frito somebody take a [Music] woo just threw the chain again well believe it or not that took up our entire day me and Tommy need to get heading back but we got a lot of projects planned so we&#39;ll be back soon we&#39;ll see you guys then all right Tom let&#39;s get the K truck out well it took a while but we got the K truck fixed and tuned up and a little bit modified put this whole bumper system on the front got some nice big fat d-rings and a 6,000lb winch we&#39;re not going to get this thing stuck anymore but we got it topped off with a new battery new coolant fixed in engine leak and I got some gauges installed so I can monitor my battery my water temp and my oil pressure and the mechanic went ahead and ordered extra parts for us so I&#39;ve got spare filters oil belts so I got all the parts I need for regular maintenance that I can put at the cabin we&#39;d love to stay and play at the cabin but me and Tommy have a lot of ATVs to buy we&#39;ve got a garage to fill don&#39;t we yes [Music] it&#39;s been about a month and a half since we&#39;ve been at the cabin and a lot has changed look at this we got to get in here with the weed whacker the bugies are bad

load since high gear was so there&#39;s truck all right guys we&#39;re here now we brought a few more ATVs up to the cabin you know people can can ride inside one place that you look at that it&#39;s

trail well we got the whole crew in the car today K drugs looking good yeah it&#39;ll it&#39;ll okay me and Tommy have been a little bit overboard with Facebook Marketplace but I got this thing for 1,000 bucks it&#39;s about 30 years old it&#39;s spray painted black it&#39;s leaking oil out of the drain plug and when you go to activate the winch the radiator fan turns on and I don&#39;t know why it would have been irresponsible to not buy it Becca how many do you have now do we count working ones yes and that and that 14 what you have 14 that&#39;s love so much [Music] now follow him Tom got

want to reach down there do yeah this battery is smoked how have to go and grab a new one next time we&#39;re in town awesome here Tom you take that pull that over I just got a phone call there&#39;s a very special delivery waiting for me at the trail head let me in time going to go check it out yeah right there stop oh I got myself a mini excavator this is a case 26c this is the smallest excavator I can find with a fully enclosed cab all right here we go as I&#39;m walking my way back to the cabin I&#39;m stopping at all these wet spots and cutting drainage ditches something I&#39;ve always wanted to do but now I have an excavator I can do [Music] it well there we go got that draining off down the hill first project I want to tackle with this excavator cuz I want to knock down this little Hill right here my K truck really struggles to get up this hill in the winter time and it gets stuck right about [Applause] here it&#39;ll be a lot easier getting up this hill in the winter oh W I love it so [Music] much look at that that is so awesome here come on up I&#39;m going to let you grab this one all by yourself wait till I&#39;m clear okay now try to lift in the hole Yeah spin that bad boy [Music] around no don&#39;t knock down my trees now push it up yeah you got it power what did you think of that was that so much fun yes I think backos are more fun than ATVs aren&#39;t they we got a basic ATV trail here we got the ramp out the back of the garage and we got ourselves a little Trail this Trail is fine right now but it&#39;s going to turn into a mud pit pretty quick especially if we keep going in the rain I&#39;m going to have to figure out a way to fill up all these mud holes we can see what the ATVs do to the dirt hey well well how are you guys doing you guys having fun yeah we&#39;re doing just fine well we got a lot done today but uh we need to start packing it up and getting these kids home grab grab a shovel we&#39;ve got a ton of this mud here I&#39;m going to do a little experiment well a bag of cement&#39;s about 80 bucks that&#39;s a lot cheaper and easier than trying to get 5 yards of gravel on this hole so we&#39;ll see what happens I probably V that all right we got a lot done on this trip but this video ain&#39;t over yet I&#39;m going to be spending like 5 days straight here at the cabin next week I&#39;ve got a lot of projects to do last time I was here I got an engine overheat warning on the dashboard and it looks like our engine coolants all gone that&#39;s not good all right there you go I filled it right up to the brim just can&#39;t see any liquid coming coming out well we&#39;ll just see what happens oh yep it&#39;s about half empty but there&#39;s still Cooling in there well we&#39;ll see what happens leaking coolant and it&#39;s overheating so something&#39;s definitely going on well all right we&#39;ll just let it sit and cool down my new water temp gauge isn&#39;t working [Music] oh there it goes can hear the fan turning on the Fan&#39;s pulling air through the radiator and I still have quite a bit of coolant something&#39;s up driving an overheated engine&#39;s a great way to destroy it though maybe the coolant not circulating I don&#39;t know oh it&#39;s overheated again I think I got to be more patient and let it sit for a little bit longer all right let&#39;s go I&#39;m going a couple hundred yards and stopping and letting it cool and going a couple hundred yards the coolant reservoir isn&#39;t warm at all I think there&#39;s a leak somewhere and the coolant isn&#39;t getting to the engine because if if the coolant was getting to the engine the coolant would be warm well it&#39;s been about 3 days since we were here last and I&#39;m curious to see how our little concrete experiment did that&#39;s hard that&#39;s not so much no it didn&#39;t really do much well back to the drawing board with that idea but it&#39;s late I&#39;m going to get to bed got a lot of work to do in the morning there&#39;s a whole bunch of sandill cranes out in the marsh behind the cabin oh that&#39;s such a cool sound solar panels are charging it&#39;s nice we&#39;re actually getting enough sunlight on the solar panels to charge the batteries up a little first thing I&#39;m going to do today is figure out where that coolant is going it&#39;s obviously leaking coolant but I can&#39;t see where the coolant going oh there it is when I pour coolant directly in the reservoir the reservoir fills up when I pour coolant directly into the radiator it falls right out I couldn&#39;t see it before for because the engine wasn&#39;t on there it is the cooling&#39;s coming out of this hose and this hose is no longer attached to this pipe and that looks like a really basic hose clamp so I think I might be able to do that myself got that hose reattached let&#39;s see what happens simple little problem easy fixed well first thing on my agenda today I want to go ahead and protect the floor of my garage with all these snow machines and ATVs coming in and out it&#39;s going to get a lot of mud and a lot of moisture on the floor and that&#39;s going to rot the wood if I don&#39;t do something to protect it so I&#39;m going to try to fix that problem today but first I need to get everything out of the garage [Music] lean look at how much mud is built up in this garage and we haven&#39;t been using it that much tell you what this floor has gotten chewed up pretty bad already first thing I&#39;m going to do is throw down a couple gallons of deck sealer that&#39;ll protect the floor from water now I just let that thing dry next thing I need to do is I need to work on this Trail I don&#39;t like these mud holes and I&#39;ve got this new trail that comes out around the garage I need to get some good dirt on top of that all right let&#39;s see what we got that&#39;s a rock right there look at that that&#39;s a rock that&#39;s a rock that&#39;s a big old rock down there got about 4 in of lomy clay then we got straight clay and then we got clay with Rock and then we got rocks with a little bit of clay those rocks are what we want if water is your problem Clay is bad rocks are [Music] good I need to start scraping away brushing clay and exposing that gravel starting to get a little nasty down there I&#39;m getting a little stuck [Music] I&#39;ll tell you what I love my mini excavator but they do get bogged down pretty easy just got these tiny little tracks I think it&#39;s time to take a little lunch break all right all right that&#39;s dry I think it&#39;s time for another coat all right got the second layer on oh there we go got ourselves a little bit of a pit mine I can get down underneath all this and start piling up dirt onto this roadway [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] only took me about 5 minutes to fill up the gas tank and look at all that water that&#39;s poured into that hole that hole is going to be coming swimming pool pretty quick I need to get my gravel out while I [Music] can went to reposition the back ho and it got stuck again and look at it just chewed the ground up and I don&#39;t want that cuz this is exactly where my Road&#39;s going I need to put the excavator right about here but I don&#39;t dare get into this mud hole otherwise I&#39;ll never get out I need some way to get the excavator into some muddy spots without it getting stuck but it&#39;s about 9:00 p.m. and I haven&#39;t had dinner so I think it&#39;s going to have to wait till tomorrow [Music] got some papusas Papas are from El Salvador and they&#39;re just a simple wonderful food only thing makes him better is a little pickled cabbage to go with it but it is almost 11:00 so I&#39;m going to put the camera up I&#39;ll see you guys in the morning good morning look at Waters came into the ruts I&#39;m going to make this project work I need to have my excavator over there but if I drive into that mud hole I&#39;m going to get so stuck so I&#39;m going to build a tool never done one of these so this will be interesting [Applause] [Music] well it creaked and bent more than I expected but it seems to be working [Music] but I just got a phone call a couple of my nephews are here they&#39;re going to come and help me out a little bit they&#39;re just down the trail and I&#39;m going to run down and pick them up hey we got a bunch of bug sprads all right thank you the all right guys welcome to the cabin um well listen guys you are welcome to play around on stuff or if you want to do some projects that&#39;s cool too try not to kill yourself I don&#39;t want to have to tell your mom that you got hurt [Music] yeah getting it done let getting late and we need to start working on another project I went and got a whole bunch of these used tiles and apparently they snapped together this will protect the floor keep it from being chewed up by the snow machine skis and the mud and the tires and all that this is actually very easy yeah is that that&#39;s not too bad while they&#39;re doing that I got to hurry up and dig more dirt that hole is filling up with water quick going to back to haul on that as soon as you get like multiple in can&#39;t remember what I paid for these but it was less than a dollar a tile this is probably one of the best Facebook Marketplace finds it&#39;s like helps out you you guys knocked that out real quick yeah look at that now should keep my floor going for a little while all right I think I got as much gravel out of this as I&#39;m ever going to get now it&#39;s time to fill up the hole I&#39;m going to grab all the scrap metal and lumber and logs that I don&#39;t need I&#39;m going to throw him in that [Applause] hole it&#39;s getting late I&#39;m starting to put things away I can hear my nephew&#39;s coming needs oh it&#39;s just right right here like we just don&#39;t know how to put the tow back in berries are tall they&#39;re like so my nephews are telling me they took the Yamaha out on a wide open area and uh got it up over 40 and then it overheated but I&#39;m suspicious that the Yamaha Viking wasn&#39;t designed to go that fast because it doesn&#39;t have any gears but this this is how we find things out right you know we&#39;re all we&#39;re all learning so yeah there it is okay it&#39;s full it wasn&#39;t turn it on and see if it drains out all right hopefully it was just low on coolant and got w worked and and that&#39;s it that would be a really easy fix I think it&#39;s time to eat some dinner and take it easy it&#39;s been a long day we&#39;re going to go ahead and put in a movie I had cut last July fishing much easier to pack withes minutes scraps of pudle gr well it&#39;s getting late I think it&#39;s bedtime we&#39;re going to hit the sack I&#39;ll see you guys in the morning well good morning all right we got a lot to do today big thing I want to do today is I want to empty out that shed move everything over to the garage cuz I want to finish this cabin off repair it up turn it into a bunk house my nephews are helping me burn up some waste wood we found a couple gallons of isopropyl alcohol in the shed Ransom you want to drive the K truck I&#39;d love to drive the K truck all right go for it a lot of these dead spruce trees I can put in the hole [Music] not super pretty but in 2 years it&#39;ll be all covered in Ferns and grass again oh it doesn&#39;t glad you guys had a good time make sure to come back okay absolutely well it was fun having company but it&#39;s time to get back to work my little platform worked pretty good but it took a bit of a beating this 2x4 busted and that 2x4 down there busted I&#39;m just going to go ahead and slap some reinforcements on this [Applause] thing we&#39;ll see how that does [Music] it is 7:30 and I haven&#39;t had dinner yet pile of bread and soup again oh it&#39;s about 8:00 p.m. but I got to push hard while the weather&#39;s nice if it rains at all this will get so muddy I won&#39;t be able to do anything [Music] woo so I was able to cover 61 ft of trail with that last pile so let&#39;s see how much we got left to do well about 60 ft I&#39;m going to start start filling this hole in [Music] [Music] well it&#39;s a quarter to midnight but we got a good pile of dirt oh no good morning oh got a lot done last night but I need to get my platform out of the mud [Music] [Music] well that stinks want to go ahead and get all the ATVs in the garage before it starts raining been out here for a little while so starting to run out of stuff all out of diesel if I can&#39;t work on the road I&#39;d like to work on the shed all right let&#39;s look at the damage here now we had a fire here in the shed you can see it did a lot of damage melted the wires melted a lot of the electrical and the lighting first thing I need to do is repair the damage from the fire repair the electrical I think that&#39;ll go a long way just right right there okay this is half in plywood I think it&#39;s time to go into town and get some diesel fuel get some Building Supplies see if we can do this yeah she&#39;s running good all righty there we go that&#39;s good all right moment of truth when it stays up without nails you know you did a good [Music] job well there we go I&#39;ve been meaning to do that for a long time but uh

we going have a little family get together and I got a brand new dump trailer too that I just bought has been pretty [Music] safe oh my goodness Tommy did you see that tree look at this it&#39;s a crap what happened look at how close it came to squish in my excavator it missed the side by side over there and the side by side over there and it missed the deck you know what they say it&#39;s better to be lucky than good let&#39;s see how this is doing this is getting hard oh wow that to drink some oh look at there there&#39;s a moose big old moose print right there see that that&#39;s a Mama moose and a baby moose [Music] just okay I&#39;ll meet you there yeah just follow him [Music] all right that&#39;s good it thr that pretty good don&#39;t need them most of the time they just yeah got everyone settled in going to take care of this thing I&#39;m trying to stay [Music] away all right it&#39;s been a low-key day we chopped up this tree and went four-wheeling with the nephew Tommy even went fishing and caught T Pike trying to make this more of a family trip and not film as much but still going to give you guys some updates from time to time oh smells real good I think we should justay and eat well L was this rug in your parents brand new yeah there we go that&#39;s good um at what point is supposed to grab you that burst Burns really good [Applause] yeah yeah just lift yeah LIF well there we go it&#39;s about 11:00 at night we got that tree cleared away well we got a lot to do today that&#39;s the key that&#39;s the turns out there you go see something about bylon there check out that pile of wood it&#39;ll need to dry for a season or two before it&#39;s ready to burn but I have got more firewood than I know what to do with if I was living here fulltime I&#39;d use this all up in less than one winter but but since it&#39;s just a getaway cabin that&#39;ll be plenty for me so I&#39;ve got a couple big projects today among other things we&#39;re going to try to tackle this mud pile and I&#39;m salvaging the wood from this collapsed greenhouse and try to get these nails out of the board additionally I&#39;m going to use the excavator to get rid of this thing we&#39;re going to see if we can&#39;t do something with these logs another thing I got to do is clear away all this scrap wood we got some pallets and scrap and I think we can use it to try to fill up some of the mud holes in the trail said I couldn&#39;t figure out how to well is if you move it left and right this spins the cab around keep going keep going keep going see that now use the thumb use the thumb undo the thumb there you go go get some more don&#39;t hit the tree don&#39;t hit the tree all right he&#39;s a smooth operat there you perfect [Music] okay I I need to get off this thing okay now open your thumb good job the slide over here Nails here that all right we got a drainage ditch cut you can see how much water is just pouring out of here yeah I mean look at how much water&#39;s coming out of that got 100 ft of this perforated 4-in pipe yeah some water stuff in he titer Tim I I don&#39;t know how traditionally you use rocks to bury the pipe so that the water can flow through the rocks and get into the pipe but getting rocks over here is really expensive and timec consuming so we&#39;re going to dump some of this scrap wood the water will flow through the wood just like it would rocks okay you fill off this I them okay it&#39;s okay to put in a couple killing two two birds with one stone finally getting this garbage out of my yard and we&#39;re filling that hole up break two three [Music] [Music] oh that was beautiful that seems pretty solid let&#39;s see if we got water still coming out oh man look at all the water down here look at that how much water&#39;s coming out of that pipe it&#39;s a lot of water getting out of there down well I used up most of my stockpile but uh I got the trail covered now we&#39;re just going to have to let it dry out my goodness got a lot done just looking better and better but man I&#39;m going to need a lot more gravel but I think this is all we&#39;re going to get done on this trip going to head back home tomorrow morning another beautiful day ah My Poor Side by Side this thing was leaking fluid let&#39;s see if it&#39;s got any in there it&#39;s about half empty but that&#39;s ATV ownership I love TR it is me and Tommy were supposed to be on an epic venture today but uh got cancelled got cancelled you going to you going to put the Nintendo 64 together yep it&#39;s maybe the biggest mistake of my life but I bought a classic Nintendo 64 got a bunch of four-person video games so family can all play video games together if the weather&#39;s nasty Tommy has kindly volunteered to assemble it oh yeah okay now what does that mean I think that&#39;s there you go Bud these are The Cutting Edge Graphics when I was in high school oh oh this is for later this weather&#39;s perfect for drying out this clay the logs from the cabin have some of these screws in them we&#39;re going to cut those screws out so they don&#39;t end up in my tires [Music] [Music] destroyed a brand new blade on a nail we need just a few more dead trees [Music] [Applause] [Music] this next Lo [Music] [Music] all right it&#39;s about 6 o00 time for dinner and Tommy&#39;s convinced me to drive all the way to town to get pizza yep yeah all right let&#39;s do it oh thank you well we got a little problem engine&#39;s overheating you see this yeah that&#39;s the radiator and what&#39;s it covered in mud and when the radiator&#39;s covered with mud it can&#39;t cool itself it&#39;s like a coat [Applause] oh that worked it&#39;s off my soda&#39;s probably going soda yeah sure and all right woohoo oh man now what I&#39;ve got to do is I got to pile up all this brush and garbage from the greenhouse and I&#39;m going to start digging down here to mine out some more gravel is that your last one it&#39;s 9:00 I think it&#39;s time to go inside got it scraped down to the gravel and ready for tomorrow we&#39;ve got a lot of material to mine tomorrow me oh guys go woo well listen guys it&#39;s late we got to put the camera up I&#39;ll see you in the morning we got a lot of work to do good morning well it&#39;s turned out to be a bit of a rainy day it&#39;s going to make things sloppy and muddy oh yeah we got a proper fish pond we&#39;ll go and scoop the water out with the bucket and start got quite a bit of material out of this hole but uh that&#39;s as far down as I can go fill it up and start another hole [Music] [Music] now we got ourselves a nice pile of dirt here [Music] well we we did it but we got about 4 to 6 in of clay and gravel down see all the way down there what a sloppy mess everything is so muddy but I swear you got to trust the process if I just let it sit for a week or two it&#39;ll turn hard look at this I spent 12 hours in the excavator today burned up 10 gallons of diesel Tommy should we go over our gas run yeah Beast off we got Diesel and popsicles right here is fine hey why don&#39;t you give your shoes a good kick we&#39;re going to air fry some pizza here there we go you turn on the air fryer it drains the [Music] batteries wo well we got food in us it&#39;s late it&#39;s time to go to bed we&#39;ll see you guys the morning well good morning it&#39;s nice and early Tom&#39;s still asleep Clay is not going to dry out in this weather but that&#39;s okay I&#39;m going to finish the electrical work on this moment of truth I think I see it now that one&#39;s in the wrong one woohoo that it kind of made the big toe on my left foot tingle a bit yay yay all right that is the electrical system done got a whole bunch of these hook organizers who need

campsite you think you can so go take that to the beach do a quick walk through make sure we didn&#39;t leave any Trash he is we&#39;re cleaned out thank you honey app it let&#39;s go we&#39;re going to an abandoned underground World War II Army base then that&#39;s the old dock to the military base they land boats there and unload supplies I was eating this and then like one popped out of my mouth oh look at that little isopod these are sea rolly pulley so this is the old Jeep Trail that you would drive trucks down from the military base now just a foot path oh you guys probably aren&#39;t enjoying this oh oh no oh hey guys look at this that is bear poop a lot of bears in this area but I can guarantee you we are not going to surprise them look at over here to the left I remember being here Dad who wants flashlights okay who&#39;s going to take we got mostly headlamps oh look at this yeah check it out guys this is an ammo bunker this is where they would store ammo but there&#39;s also be follow me the city of Seward was an important Harbor so they put a bunch of army bases at the mouth of Resurrection Bay so any ships trying to attack Seward had to make it past the fort and this is one of those Forts and it was built in World War II after the Japanese invaded Alaska oh people have oh look guys there&#39;s another building nail yeah yeah there&#39;s some Nails on the board I can&#39;t read let&#39;s keep moving there&#39;s a lot to see this fort was pretty big there&#39;s actually about 20 or 30 of these buildings throughout the forest you can spend hours looking for them all but since we have a lot of little legs with us we&#39;re going to be very selective in what we go and find it&#39;s old Foundation of one of the buildings that&#39;s where they see all the wooden Parts rotted away this whole thing was an old office building hold on we need our lights guys [Music] ready power yeah this is the generator room they have these big generators in here and that&#39;s what the power for the base [Music] was this is the mes all see come in here this room that&#39;s where they eat that&#39;s the kitchen look at the tiles yeah a lot of his base is underground cuz obviously it protects him from attack from ship artillery but also in the winter time it would snow so much that it just bury everything all right guys going to come place it says a CL oh you want to go in there let&#39;s go in here and see what&#39;s in here do we see everything is something in hey guys this is the big artillery piece they&#39;d have that would shoot any ships that try to come to Seward there was this fort fort mcgilvery here and then there was another one on top of rugged Island and there&#39;s another one on the other side Resurrection Bay and I think there was one at Rocky Point as well that&#39;s a picture of the gun right there and that&#39;s what it looked like the bullets are about that big around I know don&#39;t move anymore they guys this is the battery command station this is where the officers would give the orders and you can see that they got this bulletproof plates and they would slide along the rail here and cover up the holes in case somebody was trying to shoot at them I think these were bunk beds they go and pull them up and set them and then you could sleep on them and then fold them away I was that cool guys I&#39;m already dead no this is is that old building that&#39;s the rafters on the roof another building over there one of the fun things about this hike is that if you time the tides right you can hike all the way from Seward to the Fort well you guys want some hot dogs all right grab the snackle boxes we&#39;re bringing all of them up here here they go that&#39;s the adult one so we got a lemon Winsley Dale a
