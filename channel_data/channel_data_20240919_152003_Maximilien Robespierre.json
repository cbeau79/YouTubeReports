      "subtitles": "[Applause] hi guys sometimes I feel my mission on this channel is to call out charlatans like of farage because the media Outlets that generally Hol him certainly will not so his pet project of blaming everything that&#39;s going wrong in Britain on immigration like he previously did with the European Union is in full swing name a problem and kicking people out is the solution faraja used dog whistles and weasel words to convince his audience that he&#39;s correct but we need to call it out it&#39;s about fairness it&#39;s simply about fairness all those arguments you that you just made you know people are insense yeah that young males who by the way throw their iPhones and their passports into the channel okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s say for the sake of argument they do that now why would somebody throw their phone away before they&#39;re picked up it&#39;s interesting he he mentions iPhones here but let&#39;s say somebody throws their phone away why would they do that isn&#39;t it likely that they have been communicating with the people Smugglers all the way to that point and the people Smugglers have told them before you&#39;re picked up by border force or whoever throw your phone away because if you don&#39;t we&#39;re of course in connection with your family at home because the people smuggling begins normally in the host in the Home Country it&#39;s not something that spring up in France so if these people don&#39;t follow the rules there are possible consequences for their family so they&#39;re probably instructed throw the phone away before you&#39;re picked up because we don&#39;t want our contact details falling into the hands of the Border Force for example and I filmed this myself being out there on a small boat they Chuck them into the sea at a 12 Mile Line do you know they give a new iPhone as soon as they get it over oh no they do not they do not get a new iPhone as soon as they get to over this is a lie now why is niga farage engaging in this misleading information I thought he was trying to keep his nose clean following the riots so does border Force give people iPhones or new phones no they don&#39;t does the home office give people iPhones and and new phones generally no there may be some exceptions but generally no it&#39;s Charities that give people phones maybe they&#39;re old iPhones I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going out and buying new iPhones for for the for the Asylum Seekers why do they give them phones because they need to be in contact with the lawyers they need to attend meetings with the home office they have to attend appointments with the home office so they have to follow the rules and in in many cases a lot of this information is online so they need a smartphone to access the internet that&#39;s why Charities are giving them phones and in some cases the home office will give them phones but it&#39;s not everyone gets an iPhone as soon as they arrive no I&#39;m not making this up I promise you yes because would never Never Lie he would never make up such things he has no evidence to back up this claim just his word should we take niga far&#39;s word for this everything&#39;s free they get you know 40 quid a week money I the whole thing&#39;s unbelievable so it&#39;s about fairness remember this the last Labor government did Deport tens of thousands of illegal immigrants they did you David Blan David blankit is now what he&#39;s talking about here is people who have failed in their claim what he&#39;s talking about here is people who have overstayed their Visa or not respected their visa those people were deported but naaj is trying to spin this as well we&#39;re talking about Asylum Seekers and immigrants at the same time and what he&#39;s talking about is deporting Asylum Seekers stopping people from actually being able to claim Asylum or as soon as people try to make an asylum claim Deport them so there there&#39;s a big difference here and unfortunately all these two definitions keep getting mixed up people who have overstated their Visa or not respected the conditions of the Visa those people rightly should be deported because they have not respected the law and people who have put in an asylum claim Home Secretary was a damn site tougher than any of the conservatives were in that 14 years of failure but and here&#39;s the big difference the European Court in those days was not as activist as it is today I do not believe we&#39;ll ever sort this all the while we&#39;re part of the Court we&#39;re part of the convention that is signed into British law by the human rights act that Blair brought in in 19 and once again the nodding dog doesn&#39;t ask one question about well what impact would this have on the Good Friday agreement you keep banging on about well we need to leave the European convention on human rights in order to bring down immigration in order to deport people look we&#39;re not going to be able to deport people because we&#39;re part of the European convention on human rights it&#39;s absolute tripe he knows it&#39;s tripe but unfortunately many people watching this don&#39;t and they think oh well if we leave the European convention then we can Deport all these people Deport all these Asylum Seekers people arriving you know by dingy we can just pick them up and then take them back to where Lee Anderson would say France Richard Ty would say C you can&#39;t even if you even if the UK left the convention it would you don&#39;t leave the convention but even if they did leave the convention you can&#39;t just take people back to France you need to have an agreement but it would be breaching the UN conventions L8 and what will happen even if we were to defy the court the legislation in place means that British judges would always lean on the European convention what was the point in leave what was the point in leaving the EU and all that that involved if we don&#39;t leave the ECR what is Jeremy Kyle doesn&#39;t seem to understand the difference between the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights there is a British judge sitting on the court of human rights in Strasburg it&#39;s not a foreign court it&#39;s an international court if it was in London it would still be an international Court what was the point of brexit if we didn&#39;t leave the European convention because there wasn&#39;t a referendum to leave the European convention on human rights now people like NAA FR would love to have a referendum on that but there&#39;s no mention once again of the good Freddy agreement and what would replace it this is not about kicking up migrants out this is not about pushing back the boats this is about stripping British people of protections that they have because if the British government run rough shot over people&#39;s human rights if niga fr&#39;s prime minister someday and he&#39;s stripping people away their from their stripping the rights away from people where do they go if the UK is no longer a member of the con of the European convention on human rights it was not signed up to that where did they go well they can go nowhere that&#39;s like halfway hotel isn&#39;t it it&#39;s pointless Sharon and Wigan for you Nigel talk please ask Nigel how we get rid of the loonies out before they ruin our ukam having sleepless nights worrying about bills and all I see is illegal young men coming from dangerous countries being treated better than I am they what is an illegal young man I&#39;ve never heard of an illegal young man before once again mixing up Asylum Seekers and people who have over stay their visa but these people don&#39;t the problem here is that these people don&#39;t understand the difference and the media is not informing them on the difference there you are Sharon the bad news is it&#39;s going to get worse it&#39;s not going to get better it&#39;s going to get worse I think there is a a big sales pitch now from the criminal gangs which is look you know rwanda&#39;s gone there is almost no chance of you being deported once you get to that processing center in DOA why why would somebody not be deported see once again you&#39;re talking about Asylum Seekers the Asylum Seeker will arrive they will be processed and if their claim is invalid they will be deported like has always been the case but the problem was the conservatives were not processing claims so people were sitting in hotels they were not even Hotel even I&#39;m falling into this trap they&#39;re not hotels they were sitting in accommodation once again these are not no longer hotels if they&#39;re if they don&#39;t have all the services of a hotel so people were sitting in accommodation waiting for their claim to be processed there was a guy who was waiting 13 years or maybe it was 15 years the labor party were still in power when he began the the process of of his Asylum claim this is insane if you process the claims and you deem these people have no right to stay then they go or they make an they make an appeal if they&#39;ve exhausted the system then they are eventually deported now of course you need to have an agreement with different countries if you don&#39;t have an agreement then you&#39;re not going to be able to deport people there that&#39;s that&#39;s what that&#39;s the reality of the situation there&#39;s no way around that you can&#39;t send people to Afghanistan if you don&#39;t have an agreement with the Taliban and nobody really wants to have an agreement with the Taliban so the problem I think will get worse I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll get better I don&#39;t think starma has has even end approaching a plan to deal with it um but kind of hopes it&#39;ll just sort of go away well it won&#39;t go away and that perception of unfairness won&#39;t hide it see he started off with this idea of unfairness so that there are people coming into the country by legitimate means and those people should be protected while there are people coming in illegitimate by illegitimate means and they should be kicked out but if you create safe routs then people don&#39;t need to throw away their phon for example Ukrainian refugees didn&#39;t have to throw away their phones before they got to Britain why was that because they didn&#39;t have to rely on people Smugglers if you create safe routes then people will not have to pay these people Smugglers thousands of Euros to get through Europe and then thousands of pounds to get to Britain see faraj is not interested in proper Solutions he&#39;s interested in sniping from the sidelines and he&#39;s going to continue this over the next number of years but we need to call it out let me know in the comments section guys what you think as always your comments are greatly appreciated thanks a lot"
