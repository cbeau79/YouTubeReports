      "subtitles": "Speaker 1: A very sick looking Donald Trump\u00a0\nappeared visibly confused at a really weird\u00a0\u00a0 press conference that he did in California. Now,\u00a0\nthe topic of Laura Loomer has started to become\u00a0\u00a0 a problem for Donald Trump. There are rumors\u00a0\nthat Trump, of course, estranged from Melania,\u00a0\u00a0 is in a sexual. That&#39;s the way I heard it said.\u00a0\nIt&#39;s weird relationship with Laura Loomer. Trump\u00a0\u00a0 increasingly being asked about her and just\u00a0\nkind of acts confused whether he is confused.\u00a0\u00a0 Let&#39;s see if we can figure it out.\nSpeaker 5: Republican colleagues are\u00a0\u00a0 your allies who are concerned about\u00a0\nyour relationship with Moral Luna.\u00a0 Speaker 2: Well, I don&#39;t know what they would\u00a0\nsay. Laura has been a supporter of mine,\u00a0\u00a0 just like a lot of people are supporters,\u00a0\nand she&#39;s been a supporter of mine. She\u00a0\u00a0 speaks very positively of the campaign.\u00a0\nI&#39;m not sure why you asked that question,\u00a0\u00a0 but Laura is a supporter. I don&#39;t control Laura.\u00a0\nLaura has to say what she wants. She&#39;s a she&#39;s a\u00a0\u00a0 free spirit. Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean,\u00a0\nlook, I can&#39;t tell Laura what to do. Laura&#39;s\u00a0\u00a0 a supporter. I have a lot of supporters.\nSpeaker 1: It&#39;s funny because he tells\u00a0\u00a0 everybody what to do, even his supporters.\nSpeaker 2: But I&#39;m so I don&#39;t know what\u00a0\u00a0 exactly you&#39;re referring to. That&#39;s\u00a0\nokay. Yeah, please. I just don&#39;t\u00a0\u00a0 know. Laura&#39;s a supporter. I don&#39;t know.\nSpeaker 1: How much is she a supporter?\u00a0\u00a0 I would like for him to clarify. Is Laura a\u00a0\nsupporter? He does seem kind of nervous about\u00a0\u00a0 the answer. I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s proof that he\u00a0\nis engaged in a romantic relationship with Laura\u00a0\u00a0 Loomer. But there will be there will be time for\u00a0\nthat. But remember the the man of the evangelical\u00a0\u00a0 Christians, right. The number of divorces, number\u00a0\nof affairs, porn stars potentially engaged right\u00a0\u00a0 now in an extramarital relationship. Trump\u00a0\nasked during another element of this stop,\u00a0\u00a0 Do you denounce the bomb threats in Springfield?\u00a0\nNow here&#39;s what&#39;s going on. After Donald Trump\u00a0\u00a0 said during last week&#39;s debate, they&#39;re eating\u00a0\nthe cats. They&#39;re eating the dogs. After he said\u00a0\u00a0 that all sorts of bomb threats and threats of\u00a0\ndifferent kinds started pouring into Springfield,\u00a0\u00a0 Ohio. Again, Trump playing confused. I\u00a0\ndon&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know anything about it.\u00a0 Speaker 5: Due to downs of armed\u00a0\nguards in Springfield, Ohio.\u00a0 Speaker 2: I don&#39;t know what happened\u00a0\nwith the bomb threat. I know that has\u00a0\u00a0 been taken over by illegal migrants and that&#39;s\u00a0\na terrible thing that happened. Springfield was\u00a0\u00a0 this beautiful town and now they&#39;re going\u00a0\nthrough hell. It&#39;s a sad thing. Not going\u00a0\u00a0 to happen with me, I can tell you right now.\nSpeaker 1: So I assume Trump&#39;s lying about not\u00a0\u00a0 knowing anything about it. I assume Trump now\u00a0\nknows that the individuals he claims are eating\u00a0\u00a0 dogs and cats are not illegal migrants.\u00a0\nAnd I assume he knows at this point that\u00a0\u00a0 terrible things haven&#39;t been happening at the\u00a0\nhands of this group of Haitians who are not\u00a0\u00a0 illegal migrants. But he is stoking more\u00a0\nterror. That&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. And I can\u00a0\u00a0 only imagine that the chaos in Springfield is\u00a0\ngoing to continue, thanks to Donald Trump. At\u00a0\u00a0 another moment during this press conference,\u00a0\na reporter said to Trump, you know, all of\u00a0\u00a0 this stuff has been debunked, but yet they&#39;re\u00a0\ngetting bomb threats. And then Trump basically\u00a0\u00a0 just changes topic and talks about the border.\nSpeaker 2: Because the mayor of Springfield, Ohio,\u00a0\u00a0 the police chief, the Republican governor of Ohio,\u00a0\nhave all debunked this story about people leaving\u00a0\u00a0 pets. And now there are farm threatened schools\u00a0\nand kids being evacuated. Why do you still spray?\u00a0\u00a0 No, no, no. The real threat is what&#39;s happening at\u00a0\nour border, because you have thousands of people\u00a0\u00a0 being killed by illegal migrants coming in and\u00a0\nalso dying. You have women dying as they come\u00a0\u00a0 up. They&#39;re coming up in large groups. We call\u00a0\nit a caravan. I think I came up with that name,\u00a0\u00a0 but it&#39;s really what it is. 10,000, 15,000, 20.\nSpeaker 1: So Trump completely changing the\u00a0\u00a0 subject altogether. He really doesn&#39;t want to talk\u00a0\nabout the cats and dogs fiasco. And then finally,\u00a0\u00a0 just as a sign of the delusional\u00a0\nnature of this guy, Trump said,\u00a0\u00a0 if the votes were counted honestly in California,\u00a0\nhe would win California, which I know we&#39;re all so\u00a0\u00a0 desensitized to this sort of thing. Trump loses\u00a0\nCalifornia every time by millions of votes,\u00a0\u00a0 and the idea that if the counters were doing\u00a0\ntheir job right, Trump would win California.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#39;s arguably crazier than the cats and dogs.\nSpeaker 2: You have a very dishonest system\u00a0\u00a0 over here. If I ran with an honest vote counter\u00a0\u00a0 in California, I would win California.\u00a0\nBut the votes are not counted. Honestly,\u00a0\u00a0 it&#39;s a very dishonest system that you have.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course, the real reason Trump\u00a0\u00a0 loses California is California is overwhelmingly\u00a0\nfilled with Democrats and not Republicans. And\u00a0\u00a0 it goes back decades that Republicans don&#39;t win\u00a0\nCalifornia. But no, it always has to be special.\u00a0\u00a0 I would be the winner here and in Minnesota and in\u00a0\nNew York and in New Jersey. It seems that as far\u00a0\u00a0 as Trump&#39;s concerned, if the votes were counted\u00a0\ncorrectly, he&#39;d win every state other than maybe\u00a0\u00a0 Delaware, because Joe Biden&#39;s from Delaware\u00a0\ndelusional. And the cult around him just nods\u00a0\u00a0 and they go, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that&#39;s\u00a0\nthe way it is. So let&#39;s take a quick break. Make\u00a0\u00a0 sure you&#39;ve preordered my forthcoming book, The\u00a0\nEcho Machine at David Pac-Man, dot com slash echo.\u00a0\u00a0 I don&#39;t know how many of you are familiar with\u00a0\nthe Latin music star Nicky Jam. I actually used\u00a0\u00a0 to sort of be a fan of Nikki Jams, Wild, wild\u00a0\nstuff involving Nikki and Trump in Las Vegas"
