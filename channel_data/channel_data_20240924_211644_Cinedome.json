      "subtitles": "I&#39;ve always been extremely curious about the film making process welcome to Fight Club of David Fincher oh he of the 197 takes Fincher pushes his Caston crew to the Limit there is no reason on a shot like this ever to have a boom shadow ever for any reason at all yet wins the admiration of virtually everyone involved in his Productions he&#39;s wonderful he does too many takes but he&#39;s wonderful working with David was incredible it&#39;s probably the the best thing about this whole experience David Fincher is the most technically proficient and detail oriented director I think any of us have ever met in our lives and will ever meet you know pound-for-pound one of the most talented filmmakers around like Stanley kubri before him Fincher is notorious for making his actors do a Relentless number of takes on set Relentless number mind for some of his more recent films he&#39;s requested so many takes from his cast and crew that some of them can&#39;t even provide a ballpark figure when asked roughly how many takes they might have had to do for a given SE we would do certain scenes for 4 days straight so I don&#39;t know and you know lots of takes means very long days a regular human being would have you finishing at 6:00 or 7:00 at night but you&#39;d find yourself there some nights at 11:00 still working so what is the deal with Fincher why does he need so much time and footage to get what he wants My Philosophy is you spend $250,000 on a set you&#39;re going to bring a $150,000 crew in you&#39;re going to bring actors in from all over the world you&#39;re going to put them up in hotels and the idea is to get them out as soon as possible if I fly you in from Iceland and you&#39;re supposed to do one day I want to make sure that we get it I&#39;m going to give you 17 18 25 bites at the Apple because if you&#39;re conscientious you&#39;ve worked out in your head as an actor what it is you want to present me presentation is a weird plastic H in between what I want it to be and what the wanted to be I almost always feel like it&#39;s [\u00a0__\u00a0] I almost always feel like it&#39;s controlled this is a very interesting point because most people in the industry apparently think the opposite is true in the book The Art of the cut film editor Jeffrey Ford whose credits include 1H hour photo Public Enemies by Michael man and countless Marvel movies argues that actors are usually fresh and free of self-consciousness when they first start shooting a scene which makes them prone to make subtle errors that can actually benefit the performance and the story as they do more takes the delivery of the words and the blocking aligns more with the director&#39;s Vision but the aberration in human behavior that create Nuance are often lost Finch&#39;s process is longwinded largely because he&#39;s looking for these nuances I&#39;m always watching for the thing that you go that was surprising and interesting and weird I hadn&#39;t thought of that I&#39;m looking for the mistake that makes it look like it just happened you know but he obviously disagrees that the actors are ready to deliver them early in the shooting of a scene and so what I want to do is go great show me that we&#39;re going to shoot we shot Seven takes okay now let&#39;s start you know I know you won the Oscar last night in the tub and you figured out what this is going to be but now I want to take you to a place where you know the room so well that when you toss your book bag down and turn on your computers and walk across the room and open the refrigerator and take a bottle of beer out it looks like you&#39;ve done it a thousand times now we don&#39;t have to do it a thousand times but we may have to do it 22 times to make it look like you you&#39;ve done it a thousand times although actors clearly think very highly of Fincher this process of non-stop filming until the magical mistake emerges can really test their patients it was difficult for me I knew I was in very good company and quality so you try to do it do the best you can but it is exhausting and I&#39;ve never worked with anybody quite like that who did who does as many takes Jake Gyllenhaal expressed his frustrations with fines process in 2007 when interviewed by the New York Times about his role in zodiac he said sometimes we do a lot of takes and Fincher would turn and he would say delete the last 10 takes and as an answer that&#39;s very hard to hear more recently Charles Dan who performed in man explained to a reporter How Gary Oldman became annoyed when he had to do more than 100 takes for a scene in the film we did take after take after take and Oldman said to David at one point David I&#39;ve done this scene a 100 [\u00a0__\u00a0] times and Fincher said yeah I know but this is 101 reset now Finch&#39;s process wasn&#39;t always this rigorous Morgan Freeman has said that Fincher rarely went beyond nine or 10 takes during the making of seven and this was partly because at this stage of his career Fincher didn&#39;t have the confidence or power to push his cast and crew to the extent that he really wanted to it took me a while to get comfortable with the idea of saying another one and and I want you to think about this and I want you to think about this and I want you you know because so often you&#39;re pressed up against the glass going please don&#39;t take this the wrong way I need you to come out and I need you to try we&#39;re going to try one more you know because when you say okay let doing more you can see people go what I do wrong it&#39;s like you&#39;re not doing anything wrong I mean it&#39;s probably wasn&#39;t until I was 40 that I could kind of go here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing here&#39;s all I want and mean it and people would sort of go right away what&#39;s interesting is that Finch has started to feel free to explore in this way right around the time when digital technology was dramatically changing the film industry the new tools at his disposal were beginning to make his favorite approach cheaper and easier J took your head a little bit more to the left there easier for Fincher that is not so much for the actors I worked with him when he was blessedly still working in film so he would do like 30 or 40 and you did like the first one where he was on digital we were getting emails from Mark saying like we just passed number 80 and I just heard him say like erase the first 35 or something like that he was like in despair we would just go and go and go and go and go and so it felt quite cultish actually at the beginning of the process because it was an entirely new way of working it&#39;s perfect for him and it&#39;s not simply perfect for Fincher because it affords him more time to sharpen an individual&#39;s performance he&#39;s genuinely obsessive about harmonizing every element on the screen he is brilliant in that sense like he he sees in this panoramic kind of thing that you won&#39;t even understand until you see the movie so I realize why he does so many takes you might do six takes and the operator might blow the stand up on four of them so if you&#39;re interested in quality oper rating that means you can only use two of them when you look at it from that perspective holistically in terms of not just the performance but the position of that extra in the background or or the the continuity of someone&#39;s lapel if you look at it from that perspective and you want everything to fall into place as close as possible 10 12 takes start to seem very reasonable you know it&#39;s the people that do three or four takes in most cases are letting a lot of stuff slide which I think is unfortunate to illustrate the importance of what&#39;s being said here I want to talk about Martin scorsese&#39;s Good Fellas for a second in one scene in that movie there&#39;s a cigar in Pino&#39;s mouth during a onetoone exchange and when it cuts away and then back to the same angle again the cigar is gone when asked about this editing decision Thelma sco maker said it was because it was an improvisation with an unskilled actor who was fantastic and it was more important to use the best delivery of both people we do that all the time this is the kind of thing that drives finer [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy and justifies his meticulous approach if you shoot the scene 80 times times you maximize the chances of getting the performance on point while successfully matching the continuity it might frustrate or confuse certain cast and crew members but when a talented director like Fincher is at the helm they will ultimately trust the vision and see it all pay off in the end I would get confused about what was he needing that he wasn&#39;t getting and why and what why why do we keep doing it but even with that voice I was totally trusting of him cuz it&#39;s him and I just love his films the great thing about being on set with a director like that is you want to just give everything to them and look some actors don&#39;t even see Finch&#39;s process as being an endurance test at all they&#39;re just excited to spend most of their day acting instead of sitting around in a trailer you don&#39;t get to act that often as an actor you know most of the time he spent waiting I love the amount of time the amount of takes he&#39;d let you go until you felt that you were happy he was happy you know I loved it I remember talking to Jake Gyllenhaal when he was doing zodiac and hearing about it and just craving that kind of hard work you know craving being allowed to explore in that kind of detail I think before working with anybody that would do so many takes I&#39;d think do you really need that and the truth is I actually Excel when I have that kind of time with something because I find every moment that you could possibly find there&#39;s no stone unturned I recently made a video about Tom Cruz&#39;s relationship with Stanley kubric on the set of eyes wide shot where countless takes were filmed for every setup and given that cubric and Fincher is somewhat similar in their General approach it&#39;s worth noting a key difference between them Fincher appears to be far more engaged as an actor&#39;s director than cubrick ever was when actors were confused about what cubric wanted he would often say just do it again or Snidely state that all that he was looking for was better acting but Fincher doesn&#39;t just tell his actors to get on with it hoping that something interesting might happen somewhere down the line he knows how to give them useful feedback that can help them Reach a satisfactory place when things aren&#39;t necessarily working and as a result the actors don&#39;t have to spend all day directing themselves most people let have you come out and do your thing and sometimes you&#39;re dying for help but they&#39;re and obviously they&#39;re not going to give it to you so you have to learn how to direct yourself there are very few David finches in the world you know you going to be like he&#39;s wonderful he can he does too many takes but he&#39;s wonderful [Music]"

      "subtitles": "[Music] move get out of the way the making of Blade Runner was by all accounts a nightmarish experience for almost everyone involved the cast and crew members were hating life so much that they nicknamed the movie bloodrunner reflecting the painful nature of the shoe and when the film was finally finished and Harrison Ford found himself on the Press circuit he admitted that his recent claim that Raiders of the Lost AR was his most exhausting job ever was no longer valid I&#39;ll revise myself here and now and say that that was before I did Blade Runner which I think is probably the hardest job I ever had this was no fun in Games movie I mean this was lots of Hard physical work it was yeah the film was shot over 50 nights on the Warner Brothers lot with some scenes like the famous climax filmed for 36 hours straight in Grim conditions reallyy Scott surround you in Blade Runner with Mists and rains and fogs and everything else does that ever become a disability in the shooting he&#39;s famous for this kind of thing it&#39;s uh it&#39;s uncomfortable but it wasn&#39;t only the physical conditions that proved difficult as Harrison Ford and the film&#39;s director Ridley Scott famously failed to get along Harris and I fell out only because I was the new kid on the Block in Hollywood and I had never shot in Hollywood before so that was my first film in Hollywood okay so he hadn&#39;t filmed in Hollywood before Ridley Scott had directed countless commercials in addition to the jewelist and the massively popular alien so he was kind of annoyed to be treated like a novice on set I knew what I was doing I didn&#39;t have to be asked and told what I was doing doing all the time but by being the new kid on the Block they didn&#39;t know who I was so I had to absolutely stand by what I wanted so I became very bad tempered during the making of that as did he the bad vibes first emerged in the early stages of pre-production when it became clear that Ridley Scott wanted to suggest to the audience that the protagonist Rick Deckard is a replicant Ford wasn&#39;t impressed with this idea at all I felt that it was important for the audience to have a human representation on screen that they could identify with so I resisted the idea of being a replicant but that was just the beginning Ridley Scott was new to Hollywood and refused to play by their rule book he set up a video playback Booth away from the actors to monitor footage because back then the Hollywood Union ruled that directors couldn&#39;t operate the camera Scott&#39;s decision to isolate himself from his actors in order to review footage really bothered Harrison Ford in the words of Paul salmon a journalist on the set of Blade Runner Ridley made a tactical error because Harrison very much wanted to collaborate but the question was would Ridley allow him self to be pushed around by a major star are there times when a star is so big that they literally just do what they want and there&#39;s nothing not with me never never never you can&#39;t let that happen you&#39;ve got to be assertive and make your point quickly so they can make it back it&#39;s called intelligent negotiation an intelligent negotiation was needed throughout the entire shoe because it wasn&#39;t just Harrison Ford who Ridley Scott managed to piss off virtually everyone on set disliked him and questioned his authority department head heads who were used to making their own decisions now found themselves carrying out orders crew members were wet tired and testy with some unable or unwilling to keep up with Scott&#39;s ungracious perfectionism while making the film Scott did an interview with a British newspaper stating his preference for British film Crews because of their willingness to comply with his directions they would say yes Governor when he made a request whereas American Crews would contest every decision when crew members discovered the interview one of them made t-shirts saying yes govern of my ass as well as Will Rogers never met Ridley Scott which people then wore on set Ridley Scott asked someone who is Will Rogers and was told he coined the famous adage I never met a man I didn&#39;t like things could hardly get worse but they did the producers were getting angry now because their mandate was get it done get it done fast but Scott was moving very slowly at their expense moreover they weren&#39;t that Keen on the rushers they thought they&#39;d signed off on an entertaining action sci-fi flick like Star Wars instead they had this dystopian Metropolis with an alcoholic hero who shoots women in the back their concerns were intensified when test audiences found the film underwhelming and ultimately confusing so they made the bloody terrible mistake to include a voiceover to ensure various points were hammered home Harrison Ford was very unhappy about this because he had initially insisted he wouldn&#39;t play deard unless Ridley Scott agreed to remove the narration from the original script and now after an arduous shoot those wretched lines were thrown back in I was obliged by my contract to record that narration which I found awkward and uninspired he said and he was right the voice over is beyond terrible especially towards the end the film draws us to this incredible scene where R gau&#39;s character accepts his mortality and Spares deca&#39;s life even after he&#39;s killed his lover and delivers that beautiful monologue I&#39;ve seen things you people wouldn&#39;t believe and then all of a sudden this moment of cinematic Perfection turns into a steaming pile of Hors poo as the clunkiest bit of VoiceOver ever recorded but sin I don&#39;t know why he saved my life maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before maybe I guess in those last moments he appreciated life more than ever before like yes I know that thank you thank you for kicking this this this beautiful delicate emotional note that we were achieving right in the nuts the movie received a mixed reception upon its release and Harrison for tried to be diplomatic when asked about the personality of Ridley Scott oh I don&#39;t know if I don&#39;t know that it serves any of us well to to try and describe very in short terms the difference in personalities but everyone is a different person Works in a different way perhaps Ford only had himself to blame for his discontent during the making of Blade Runner as Sha young suggested he wasn&#39;t in the healthiest condition Harrison was very unhappy during the the filming of Blade Runner partly because at the time he had a coap yeah we see what you&#39;re doing there Harrison anyway Ridley Scott re-edited the film about a decade later eliminating the joke of a voiceover and transforming the movie status into that of a classic I highly recommend you watch the making of Blade Runner on YouTube to understand just how unique and challenging and conflict Laden the production was it&#39;s really interesting or you can click on this video here it&#39;s about the difficulty of working with Stanley kubric and it&#39;s not bad"

      "subtitles": "the year was 1996 and Tom Cruz was having the time of his life mission impossible in Jerry Maguire had been warmly received by critics and audiences alike in the first half of the year making him the Hollywood star of the moment and now he had the privilege of working with Stanley kubri on the director&#39;s first film in almost a decade Cruz was in London when he originally received the script titled Eyes Wide Shut the script is about 90 pages long 92 pages long I remember putting it down and just sitting back for about 45 minutes I was I was stunned I&#39;d never read anything like it but as pleased as he was with the material the decision to be a part of Stanley Kubrick&#39;s Legacy was never in doubt I knew in my mind I was going to make the moveie even before he sent the script whatever it was I was going to do it Cruz and his then wife Nicole Kidman signed open-ended contracts allowing cubric to keep them on set for as long as he deemed necessary that was Kubrick&#39;s way because he&#39;s incredibly compulsive and he shoots every image about a hundred times or more he wants every image to be perfect Kubrick&#39;s perfectionism was well known to everyone in the industry especially after The Shining which was set for shooting for about 4 months but ended up running for 11 months and was a hellish experience for actress shelle Duval I resented Stanley at times because he pushed me and it it hurts we&#39;re fing killing ourselves out here and you got to be ready I am too I&#39;m play mood music why do you want to do this to me how can you do this to me I was really in and out of ill health working with cubric wouldn&#39;t be light work but a challenging shoot was no issue for Cruz he was an actor at the top of his game and the script for eyes white shop was only 90 pages long so even if cubrick was destined to take his time it surely wasn&#39;t going to be one of the director&#39;s longest running Productions and as shooting began Cruz fell on top of the world there&#39;s a pinch yourself attitude yeah there really is I mean I look at my wife we working with Stanley kuri right now and you just kind of go my God but Cruz soon realized he would disappear from movie screens for the next 2 and 1/2 years as eyes white chop became the longest running continuous film shoot in film history 400 Days of production 400 Days of production of that movie we&#39;re not talking about Spartacus here we&#39;re talking about eyes wide shut you could film that script in 28 days easy easily easily it is not a difficult script it&#39;s true ice white shop was far from the most logistically complicated shoot in the world and most directors could film it pretty quickly so it wasn&#39;t a surprise when people started asking what took so long what what took so long well you know when you&#39;re working the most important thing to Stanley was time and that&#39;s what he paid for when when he made a movie time was the most important thing hence the famous number of takes that he does which is not a myth I found out 70 takes 80 takes 100 takes were was absolutely regular with st see cuic had deliberated over the story of iswi shop for decades after reading the novel dream Story by Arthur schnitzler and when he finally decided he was ready to pull the trigger and make the movie he wasn&#39;t going to be hurried if he wasn&#39;t delighted with a performance by take 10 he was prepared to shout action 100 times more until he was but interview footage of the film&#39;s cast suggest that it was primarily Cruz who cubic was intent on pushing to the limit to be honest with you I didn&#39;t personally have to do that many takes but I had to be in the scene when Tom was doing it I mean there were two shots so it&#39; be over my shoulder or whatever so I had to do it that many times and with Tom we regularly went above 70 and 80 takes all the time I mean sometimes you do two takes and you&#39;d walk away said but Stanley Stanley kind of kind of have another one you go I think we got it we got it you walk away and then other ones you do 80 so if Kidman and Pollock often had a li to load what was the problem with Cru a rare audio clip of cubric possibly offers some answers actors are sometimes undisciplined enough not to go home and go to sleep at night and learn their lines they cannot Act without KN dialogue if you have to think about anything when you&#39;re acting you cannot work on the emotion it&#39;s happened on every film there&#39;s not much you can do about so you wind up with this particular actor you know maybe doing 30 takes I don&#39;t do a lot of takes when it&#39;s good now Cruz is renowned for being the ultimate professional so he was undoubtedly well prepared every day he arrived on set but if curic insists he wouldn&#39;t do 30 takes or more if the performance were good we might assume he wasn&#39;t thrilled about Tom from a creative perspective once production was up and running another possibility is that cubrick deliberately used his many take methodology to create and cruise the confusion anger frustration and sense of humiliation necessary for the portrayal of Dr Bill a character experiencing all of those emotions and if that&#39;s the case it seemed to work I just get frustrated with myself at times that we couldn&#39;t get it you know what I mean it was just like you know [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know you feel frustrated at times playing a character like that for so long and I remember talking to Stanley and I said Stanley I have to know are we going to finish in 6 months you know this is after shooting am I going to finish but can I can I set meetings and have people because people were waiting watching these clips you sense the cruise was still carrying some of the pain of the production process it seems that it was more than he bargained for I&#39;ve never been through an experience like this it it was uh so consuming of of my life Tom Cruz is in every scene of eyes white shut so doing countless takes day after day for 400 Days must have been pretty exhausting but on some level it must have been embarrassing for him too when an actress like Vanessa Shaw who played the hook of domino in the movie had to extend her contract from 2 weeks to 2 months because he couldn&#39;t satisfy cuc&#39;s taste before take 70 of virtually every shot she was in and it must have been embarrassing when a fellow actor Lex Sydney Pollock was forced on his behalf to say it&#39;s not going to get any better Stanley I think cubric battered Cruiser&#39;s morale over over the course of 15 months and subsequently the actor was happy to escape into the world of Paul Thomas Anderson I&#39;m glad I did Magnolia after I finished because it would it helped me with Anderson he was back to normality doing five or six takes per setup and moving on and given his performance in Magnolia is stronger than his performance in I white sh you might wonder whether 100 takes is really necessary many filmmakers think not like telling the joke 19,000 times the J doesn&#39;t get funny after four takes if you&#39;re doing 30 40 50 takes you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing some actors would be inclined to agree including Harvey kitel who was initially cast in Sydney Pollock&#39;s character in eyes white shut and was ultimately fired from the film he&#39;s walking through a door and I think after the 68 take of this walking through the door Harvey cartel just said yeah he said I&#39;m out of here you&#39;re [\u00a0__\u00a0] crazy 68 takes a walking the door you&#39;re [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of your mind and that was it yeah left he would just say do it again not why or do it differently what are you looking for yeah just do it again but as much as working conditions of this kind might raise eyebrows and annoy industry professionals it&#39;s quite likely that Cub&#39;s approach was instrumental in creating the distinctive feeling of his films I mean if cuck&#39;s process was as streamlined as that of other directors would eyes wide sh have turned out to be as strange and bewitching as It ultimately is I highly doubt it and ultimately it makes little sense to question cuck&#39;s methods when the work is interesting however where eyes white chut is concerned it&#39;s worth noting how Cruz&#39;s career trajectory changed shortly after the making of the film this is the year where something happens to Cruz and his career after this moment of the eyes wide shut and Magnolia is markedly different than it was before before eyes wide shut and including Eyes Wide Shut there was this guy that balanced populism and pure genre escapism with more actorly Ambitions and after eyes white shut it&#39;s almost like okay well I&#39;m not doing that again it&#39;s a bus this is maybe the Eyes Wide Shut thing is look I have a limited window here"
