      "subtitles": "Mark Zuckerberg known for his appearance in the hit miniseries iBook has recently switched his Focus from simulating Friendship to simulating murder that&#39;s right he&#39;s been dabbling in a little bit of the Jiu Jitsu falsely advertised as the gentle Arts now obviously he is a man of means he can afford to pay for the best coaching and training in the world but that alone will not get you the skills that he wants if you&#39;re not going to apply yourself to go through the grind like we all do in the words of the great George RR Martin there is no Royal Road to jiu jitsu or maybe that was CM Punk actually how good at Jiu Jitsu is the Zuck today we&#39;re going to take a look at some training between him and Lex Friedman a jiu jitsu black belt who needs no introduction we&#39;re just gonna be taking a look at some key moments that I find to be very telling for reasons that we will get into if you want to watch the full training session in its entirety I&#39;m gonna link that down below go give it a watch make up your own minds this breakdown is going to be split into three different parts the basics I.E the fundamentals and how well he executes on them he Road a map which is basically his overall understanding of the broader Concepts and finally his standout moments I.E moves that he has a natural Affinity towards natural Affinity what the hell am I saying moves that he&#39;s naturally good at now we all know that grip fighting is an important part of Jiu Jitsu but just like that guy that always skips foreplay when I say use your hands I could be speaking a different language to you in this example we see that as Lex is trying to engage him duck is gonna push him away because he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with where this is going it&#39;s a general rule of thumb whatever your opponent is trying to do you want the opposite of that as Lex is trying to work his guard a little Eric is using his hands to control his feet as he knows this is where the threats comes from but he makes the mistake of letting him get his shoulders off the mat which allows him to stand back up Alex is obviously being a nice partner letting Zuck work here a little something Lex is doing is throwing a lot of moves at Zuck but not really putting any power behind them this is similar to what happened when I sparred Jeff Chan he was throwing high volume on the punches but going very light on the power so none of them actually hurt which is just called to be in a nice training partner again we see that Mark is using these grips to try to off balance Lex set up a guard pass but he&#39;s gonna use this straight arm to get his back off the mat and then start the dreaded butt scoot which Mark is clearly not a fan of again we see some good defensive grips here by Mark he also knows to shoot his hips back making it hard for next to go for a takedown or something but he&#39;s fallen into Lex&#39;s head and sleeve grip which he uses to go for a snap down into single leg clearly Zuck knows he needs to go for a wizard gear he allows his leg to be pulled across Lex&#39;s body it gives him an easy takedown but Mark is going to use that same head and sleeve grip to set up his own Single Leg Takedown now he is making the mistake of looking down compromising his posture this would make it easy for Lex to go for something like a guillotine or just defend the takedown if he wanted to he makes the same mistake here looking at the ground but then kind of fixes his posture as Lex is dancing around a little he converts it to a nice little double A and again is being proactive with his grip fighting looking for a pass Aramark has found himself in top quarter guard Lex has a solid underhook here which he can use to pop out the back door and start setting up an attack like so Mark understands he needs to sprawl out shooting his hips back he is making the mistake of putting his knees on the ground just taking the pressure off of Lex but as Lex is sitting up with an arm drag Mark knows he needs to break that off and get out of there so what do I mean by road map this is how you fit your moves together essentially to get from point A to point basically if you start in a given position say side control you understand the routes that you have to get out of there and start progressing your own game in this example we see Marquis in his grips looking for some sort of guard pass his leg sets up he understands that he has a route to circle around and take his back from here he&#39;s looking to control the hands probably trying to slide his hooks in but he&#39;s given Lex too much space to work he understands he&#39;s not gonna get the back here so he&#39;s gonna instead transition into North South control which kind of sounds like the name of a movie made for modern audiences here he&#39;s let Lex get deep on a shot he&#39;s gonna go for a guillotine attempt as Lex takes him down now that&#39;s not the tightest Guillotine I&#39;ve ever seen But as he&#39;s controlling the head he&#39;s gonna push off on the legs this is gonna allow him to pull that bottom leg in and putting Lex in his closed guard which is a good play by him using the guillotine attempt to keep himself from being put inside control and our last clip he&#39;s gonna use these grips this is gonna pop up to the side and Mark&#39;s gonna Circle to his back this time he&#39;s able to grip his hands together for a solid over under control he&#39;s gonna put his top hook in and then pull Lex off to the side allowing him to to do a little bit of finagling to put in his other hook here he knows he wants Lex off to his side instead of being on top of him from the back he&#39;s gonna go for a textbook finish the rear naked choke so overall it seems he has a pretty good understanding of how to chop up something like point A to point B into a lot of smaller steps now he is missing some of the finer details like we already said his posture could be better he could have better balance for places like this but all that will come with time if he continues to put in the work for somebody who has been doing Jiu Jitsu for only one year now I&#39;d say his progress looks pretty good I mean he did win his first Jiu Jitsu tournament ever so um yeah he&#39;s already done better than me there now as far as his standout move there are a couple that come to mind first of all it&#39;s very clear that he loves taking the back here he&#39;s gonna Circle get stopped by the underhook and then Circle all the way around continuing to attack the bat I mean just look at the way he&#39;s gonna throw his leg over that arm just like Gordon Ryan what kind of beginner is doing that also of note is this nice little scooping double a likes to hit it off the single attempt but also when he has legs pinned up against the wall he&#39;s simply gonna pop a squat grab his legs get the takedown but by far what I find most impressive is north south joke once he locks it up he&#39;s gonna shoot his hips backward like Marcelo Garcia thinking his bicep intellects his neck he&#39;s gonna go for it again in this clip that should be obvious here that Lex hasn&#39;t been going more than 10 this entire training session but I mean that&#39;s a clean ass north south choke I&#39;m a brown belt and I still struggle to do it now this is just a summary of their training session I&#39;m gonna put a link for the full thing down below highly recommend checking it out it&#39;s clear that Mark is very much into Jiu Jitsu you&#39;re not just gonna be pulling those north south chokes out of your ass like that if you&#39;re not who knows maybe we&#39;ll even see him at an 80cc a few years in the future"

      "subtitles": "on today&#39;s episode of Judge Jedi I catch a black belt cheating to try to get the drop on me [Music] cheater man that&#39;s what you get that&#39;s what you get now let&#39;s talk about greasing for a second that&#39;s where you put lubrication all over your body so whenever you start to sweat it makes it so much harder for your opponent to control you and could easily give you that five to ten percent Advantage you need to win a close matchup now I&#39;ve already tested it out and yes definitely seems to make a small difference however all my training partners that I tested it with were white belt so I had no idea how much of a difference it was gonna make between me and an equally skilled opponent cheating is a serious offense so I had to know what has to go wrong in a human being&#39;s life to make them stoop to such a level where they think that using Lube is cool one thing was clear I was gonna have to roll up my sleeves and do some Hands-On research so our black belt Tyler seems to have had a pretty normal childhood rolling around with all the kiddos in the neighborhood and he did get bullied a little but I mean you know kids they do a little bit of trolling all no nothing seemed too out of the ordinary until of course my investigation would uncover something extremely grotesque after an extended trial Tyler would be exiled from his gym on pain of death for the heinous crime of making YouTube videos [Music] just the thought of doing something so evil it sickens me to my core but it doesn&#39;t stop there space alone will not protect this treasonous the crime of making videos for the online he would be hounded from all sides by the hands of his former family I had to leave our gym you know it was kind of sleazy the way he&#39;d slap Guillotines and Ankle locks on white belts non-stop I&#39;m gonna strangle this guy this guy&#39;s a blanket but did he actually deserve the Heat this is something I needed to know before I cast judgments on him which is why I went to one of his classes to see how he actually is in person he was going over the guillotine because duh and honestly I got a couple little nuggets that I&#39;m gonna put in my pocket for later but the best way of learning from somebody is by rolling with them of course we&#39;re gonna start off this round with some grip fighting it&#39;s like the foreplay of Jiu Jitsu I&#39;m trying to grab his head and he&#39;s trying to grab my arm I wonder what he&#39;s going for well I guess he was looking for a lateral draw I end up straight in side control not looking too good for me off the open he must think of one of his white belts to pick on because he instantly goes for a straight ankle lock I&#39;m gonna wiggle my way back because I&#39;m honestly a big fan of this carpet now as soon as he gets in close like this again I know he wants to go for that lateral draw so I&#39;m pushing off on his hips and it works he does not get the takedown this time but he&#39;s so deep under my hips he&#39;s easily able to switch into single leg X here I know he wants that foot lock again but by golly so do I and his foot&#39;s right in my face now what we have here is a little footsie standoff as I like to call it however my ankles have five years of skateboarding experience so I kind of like my chances here after I go belly down he&#39;s gonna bail on the leg looking to free his now he knows he needs to fight off my feet with his hands not so he can go for a foot lock rather so he can get his hips a lot closer to mine because if he lets me make space and hip in it&#39;s not gonna be looking too good for his foot now I&#39;m able to step on his hip which is giving me some space to hip in but the problem for me is that his knee is pointing up as opposed to out to the side he&#39;s giving him that tiny little pocket of space that he needs and as you see he&#39;s able to get his hips closer to mine again taking away my leverage now I also have to protect my feet at the moment you can see I&#39;m wiggling them this way and that way trying to keep him from grabbing them I really would like to get this straight ankle here but my arms are about to burn out side to side it&#39;s time to go on to something else so we&#39;re both gonna just stand up bro allowing us to reset and get our bearings now he likes the lateral drop but what about the lateral flaw well guess not sadly he&#39;s grabbed my head and put me into his signature move I know things could get bad here quick which is why I&#39;m shaking his hand and right before I pop out he&#39;s gonna let go of the head to spin behind fighting those hands trying to stay balanced but he&#39;s gonna get that trip get a kick off on his hips looking to stand up but he is spamming that Guillotine like it&#39;s rivers of blood I&#39;m Gonna Roll away from him to take away the choke and as I pop to my side he&#39;s gonna look for a DARS choke but then decides he&#39;s just gonna spin behind now from here he&#39;s putting good pressure on me I&#39;m in kind of a difficult spot but as I&#39;m basing looking to stand up gives up control of my hips looking to take my back which is a mistake because it allows me to shake off his one hook and as soon as he switches his grips I grab his hand spin spin and get out we&#39;re gonna see a guard pool to scuff triangle attempt to scuff straight ankle attempt imma kick off and pop up he looks for choke but I get takedown I&#39;m a smash him flat looking to pass but he pops on his side threatens with choke and is able to stand up the round is almost over so I&#39;m a cartwheel into a takedown constantly finishing and winning the round on point oh wait no he put me in a guillotine and I&#39;m looking to fight the hands but he steps over into Mount and then he hits in real hard oh okay all in all fun little Noki round maybe Tyler isn&#39;t such a bad guy after all now at this point I honestly thought everything was good and gravy you know Tyler he had come from some dark places but through the power of Jiu Jitsu he has become a more wholesome individual but then I made the mistake of asking him this question so what&#39;s your opinion on greasing in competitive Jiu Jitsu greasing I feel I&#39;m gonna strangle this guy this guy is a blanket I know he&#39;s been slacking a lot he&#39;s got just a guillotine game and that&#39;s it [Music] it is now the next day and I have to teach a little bit of nogi so I decided I was gonna take Tyler under my wien a lot like Obi-Wan and Anakin completely oblivious to the treachery that he would soon unavail I was going over a little bit of the basics also going over some of the fancy schmancy stuff as well he wants to get his head below mine so I need a glass was done Tyler asked me if I wanted to roll with him again wish I said no problem with of course that is when he would Sprint his devious little trap on me like Hannibal at Kanai so we&#39;re gonna slap it and bump it just like your mom start off with some good old hand fighting as usual I&#39;m hearing my voice the visceral visceral is cheating like an aim body and hacker in fortnite he had thrown down the gauntlet and made it abundantly clear he had no intention of getting beat it was now my job to do exactly that I can feel him pushing into me so I&#39;m gonna look for that lateral flop that didn&#39;t work because last second he pushes on my hit which gives him the balance he needs to defend it now I&#39;d usually be chilling here grabbing that left arm but since it&#39;s thicker than a politician in August I decide to go for a body lock which seems a little more firm but this grease ball is gonna squirm his way out and keep the top position right here now here he&#39;s gonna dig in that cross face and he&#39;s gonna use his head to try to isolate my arm looking for an arm triangle but we all know Guillotine Andy only has one move he&#39;s gonna flop into North South I grab his leg pulling myself into Turtle but this deep fried gingerbread man is gonna go for the only submission that he knows here his hands are so slick I can&#39;t even grab a hold of them and he just flops to the back like the dirty little politician he is here I&#39;m fighting his hands and also have my weight on top of his bottom legs this makes it hard for him to move I can feel an opening so I underhook his leg looking to pop up he&#39;s gonna go for the front headlock once again and I have no shot of breaking this slippery ass grip he has and he&#39;s able to hit the deck you can see he&#39;s looking to finish like Uriah Faber but I ain&#39;t having it finally get his squirmy hand off of me I hear things are gonna get a little dirty he tries to yank me over like he&#39;s been asking or something again he&#39;s trying to go for a submission that is not a guillotine his arm triangle defense I actually learned by watching a movie guess which one and I&#39;ll give you a crisp high five now he&#39;s biting down here a little things are getting kind of tight normally this would be a bad position but I mean it&#39;s Guillotine Andy were talking about so it&#39;s a trivial thing for me to free my arm I&#39;m then gonna go double underhook and clamp down on his leg like so this is called lockdown for all you non 10th Planet cult members I&#39;m thinking about hoyler Gracie in his ass but decide nah I&#39;m just gonna keep things a little basic here if I give up the triangle and go for this sort of control this is the form of half guard that nobody uses but they should because it&#39;s nutty unless of course their legs are slicker than a pole on a table here I have zero grip whatsoever he&#39;s really starting to sweat like a tryhard in a Cod lobby as if greasing wasn&#39;t enough now he&#39;s going super dirty trying to waterboard me with those greasy ass moves of his he calls over his cam girl because I guess he has something he wants to say he said you should subscribe right now he&#39;s gonna come to your house strip down and wrestle your ass with nothing but vegetable oil he had hit his high Benchmark and Karma was now barreling down to put him in his place here I use my elbow to push his foot into my legs as I turn into him he&#39;s gonna look for a guillotine I&#39;m gonna shrimp out force him over the side I&#39;m gonna bring my left leg through clamping down start looking to elevate his hips so I can attack a knee ball he&#39;s trying to set his weight on me so I can&#39;t get to his leg so I&#39;m gonna step on his arm pushing him away I still don&#39;t really have the elevation I need so I&#39;ma readjust and really stomp him forward this is gonna get his way off of his butt which lets me grab that foot and surf up a little karmic Justice cheater man that&#39;s what you get since he&#39;s all lubed up he&#39;s gonna go for the whiskey dick bait imma jump on him locking up a darscho as he sits out looking to pop into side control I have a decent grip on his neck so he&#39;s gonna let go of my legs looking to make some space here I&#39;m gonna start facing down his hips trying to finish that show he&#39;s trying to stack his shoulders over my chest taking a little of the pressure off so I&#39;m gonna hit a little Gator Roll underneath him I&#39;m gonna look to step over into Mountain lock it up tight he&#39;s put me in his little guard pulls out one last ditch cheat before the timer brings the round to an end all right bro ggs cheating gives you an advantage but it ain&#39;t gonna make up for skills"

      "subtitles": "this is Josh he is a silver medalist a judo black belt and a professional cage fighter with a record of 13 wins and one loss but right now I know none of that last week it went out to the beautiful Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago to teach them Jiu Jitsu with everybody&#39;s favorite Canadian and um whoever this guy is so after a little bit of rolling around in the sand which um is a terrible idea don&#39;t ever do it it was time to kick things off with the first training session of the week so we&#39;re gonna go for the meet and greet Open Mat I&#39;ve been rolling around in the sand a little bit so I got a little bit of a black eye going on we ended up hitting two rules with Josh first one I&#39;m going in cold not knowing his true power level second round way more exciting but you&#39;re gonna have to stick around if you want to see it okay three two one so I&#39;m gonna kick off the round by um painting out you know chilling vibing it&#39;s Jiu Jitsu honestly like who wants to go hard here you can see he&#39;s trying to grab my legs some people do that because it turns them on but he is doing that so he can control me and pass into side control which is why you see me sit up into him and start working some of that hand fighting rip fighting is by far the most fundamental and also the most boring part of Jiu Jitsu the whole idea is getting a little Tempo going so you can progress to The Next Step think of it as uh oh yeah first base I&#39;m gonna pop up because I&#39;m getting a whole lot of nothing and he&#39;s gonna sit down to try to work some of that car I love this move right here grab the foot push on the shoulder gonna flatten him on the mat which is gonna make it harder for him to attack me I&#39;m gonna slide his legs over and plop by into side control he&#39;s trying to push me away make some space so I&#39;m shifting my hips here and there somebody kicks me I look back and boom he&#39;s gonna pop up with an underhook I&#39;m thinking about a triangle but he knows to keep his hands inside I can&#39;t throw my leg over his shoulder so the turns have tabled here a little he&#39;s got a good little knee slice going on here I&#39;m using my knee to create distance so he decides to back up looking for a standing pass I&#39;m honestly a big fan of just standing up bro so that&#39;s what I do here from Denise he&#39;s gonna go for a body lock so I use my overhook looking for an Uchi motto if I would have known he&#39;s a black belt in Judo probably wouldn&#39;t have done that he&#39;s threatening with a back take but I&#39;m about to pop out the back door so last second he grabs my leg and rolls through to stay behind I&#39;m gonna try to roll on my shoulders here but notice how he&#39;s got my left arm trap a little bit of a khabib move which is honestly a great control position if you really want to punch somebody right in the kiss with a little bit of elbow grease I&#39;m able to wiggle my way out of it since I&#39;m sitting up he&#39;s looking to attack my head I&#39;m gonna pop up and attack his head instead he&#39;s got good grip fighting I know he&#39;s about to pull out as he does I switch to the single leg I&#39;ll look to run the pipe I&#39;m gonna switch I&#39;m gonna hoist him up look for a trip but notice how he&#39;s doing a good job of keeping his hips and his base away from me also he&#39;s using his left hand to help him create distance as well you can see I barely have any grip at all here so I&#39;m let go he&#39;s gonna reshoot on me turn the corner I&#39;m gonna finagle my hips away from him I&#39;m offending the takedown it&#39;s kind of hanging out on his knees here you might think he&#39;s in danger of getting his back taken or choke but that is what the grip fighting is for even if you&#39;re in a slightly strange position if you know the basics of control you&#39;re chilling bro he goes for little sweep single but instantly grabs my second leg chopping out my base so I can&#39;t get away from him and look to stand back up so he jumps on my back throwing one hook in but you know your boy got those thick thighs pulling on his right arm which is making him feel like he&#39;s gonna fall off the side you can see him readjust but I&#39;m able to put my shoulder in his chest and eventually spin out of danger he&#39;s gonna go back to the well on that shot turn the corner I&#39;m using this left arm to put weight on him allowing me to get back up he still does have my leg but I&#39;m gonna spin around to his back from here I&#39;m pinching my knees together to keep him from doing any sudden movement but he&#39;s gonna go back to the fundamentals of hand fighting he&#39;s gonna break my bear hug heading up to his feet and doing a little sploosh splash spinner two seconds left on the board he goes for a buzzer beating flying arm bar attempt I respect the send on that one of course I wanted to run that back but this time knowing that he was scaled more toward end game I knew it was gonna have to be slightly sharper because the smallest mistake could easily spiral way out of control but first sponsor time hey you it&#39;s your internet Jiu Jitsu bro are you tired of showing up to class and having no drip well fear not because xmarshall.com has you covered they are a premium Jiu Jitsu brand you get everything from a geese to rash guards that are not only very classy but also premium quality I like the innuendo rash guard because haha the Monkey C Monkey tries and the I should probably put on more clothes so I don&#39;t scare anybody away or should I there will be a link down in the description where you can get decked out and reviews of this channel you get a special 10 off when you use the discount code Jedi at checkout you can also sign up for their emailing list for even more insane discounts support the channel and look cool while you&#39;re doing it add over all right this is for all the marbles where the winner be team khabib or a team Jason Momoa there&#39;s like any good game we gotta start off by checking what all the buttons do and pump in some fakes out here because I do have commitment issues I was teaching class before this round where I went over the sick takedown so of course I have to hit it live well it&#39;s the thought that counts so I didn&#39;t get the take down here but this little combo is something I do quite often I touch his head he grabs my wrist I slap his wrist down my fake the arm drag on his left and then instantly switched to his right you may know I am a fan of the sitting arm bar Josh wasn&#39;t over committing to the caller tie which is what happened here so he&#39;s able to pull himself back keeping me from getting a solid bite ah group fighting that&#39;s like another way of saying I&#39;m waiting for the right moment but I mean hey Judo black belts a little scary Josh is gonna drop down for a double leg but this underhook of his has become a liability as you can see I&#39;ve got his arm trapped I&#39;m hipping off to the side looking for an Oma Plata attack he&#39;s Gonna Roll I try to go for the armbar but he&#39;s able to pull his arm out I&#39;m gonna try to get up real quick but he&#39;s like nah bro stay down but as he pulls back on the front kick him in the ABS giving me the space I need to get back up to my feet I have a two-on-one grip here trying to bait him into grabbing my head so I can do this but he&#39;s just not given me the response I want can you believe it swims for an underhook to set something up I am thinking about a flying triangle from here right as I go for it he hits me with that you don&#39;t even know about it bro you don&#39;t indeed I&#39;m gonna try to go for the armbar again but he&#39;s like nah bro remember me I&#39;m the guy that did this and then out of nowhere boom inverts looking for a foot lock now truth be told I really don&#39;t have footlock defense I kind of just grab a hold of their feet and try to get something in return is this something I would recommend no not really I do have a solid bite on his foot and I have never been in this position before but I instinctively pull it over looking for the heel hook and get the tap we&#39;re doing a little push pull again I&#39;m gonna go for that two on one but he&#39;s framing on my head keeping me away someone switch to an overhook and boom hits me with that Tayo Toshi I&#39;m able to regard this time I have a clamp on his right arm so I&#39;m able to throw my leg over now he is in danger but it&#39;s not a done deal since my legs aren&#39;t crossed he can steal posture uh which is why I&#39;m gonna pull his head down this is gonna give me the space I need to lock up the full triangle he&#39;s gonna sit back to alleviate some tension and I just sit up with him and after a little bit of finagling I get the tap shout out to Josh for the solid round get this video to 10 000 likes and I&#39;ll fight him"

      "subtitles": "last time on Dragon Ball y Jedi takes on Canadian black belt Jordan but fiends go awry when he goes for this take down oh no this is not good thank God he&#39;s got those YMS though to carry that weight now Jedi prepares for his rematch with Jordan but not only is he battling against the clock but also every Jiu Jitsu Bros nightmare cardio Leo he rise to the occasion or not find out video presented by topshopjedi.com buy some merch it&#39;s cool what&#39;s up guys me and Jordan were throwing a camp in about two weeks from now I have just been sick for like the past week running a fever of 103 which is absolutely sapped all of my Jiu Jitsu skills out of my body and so we&#39;re gonna go ahead get some tough training in give it to me to try to react our bodies so that we&#39;re ready to give you guys the best experience at this camp good old see you makes you want to go pee so I ended up going to this place called Odin&#39;s Hall and appropriately enough got partnered up with utrez son of utre very cool now in addition to getting put to work by anorexic Voldemort and Justin Bieber He&#39;s also got some of that wrestling and you know me I love a good old scramble hello we have here&#39;s a little case of wrestlers doing a wrestling ass stuff so I&#39;m trying to get some of that head but he pulls back grabbing my leg kind of pops out the back door as I&#39;m looking for a back step he&#39;s got a pretty solid bite on my leg so I&#39;m posting with my hands as I&#39;m looking to fight his hands he&#39;s gonna pull the rug out from under me just like your favorite crypto bro oh I&#39;m a wrestler I never take the back so I really want to get back to my feet and I&#39;m looking to peel his grips off of me instead of chasing my back he switches to the single and then pops up then you can go for a little don&#39;t ask me how to do that I couldn&#39;t tell you now we&#39;re gonna go a little delihiva but use that to get back up he&#39;s got that arm draped around my hip so I&#39;m like hey send it triangle guard passes are really cool but sadly he&#39;s doing a good job of using that elbow to keep my hips just far enough away that I can&#39;t get my InStep into the crook of my knee so unfortunately not an instagramable moment I should have bailed for top position but I live and die for the knee fortunately doing more dying than living here that posture is not getting broken down so yeah cool idea but in execution not terribly realistic kind of like communism so he&#39;s looking for a little throw by guard pass so I&#39;m gonna push off on that elbow and see how he sits in here he knows I want to get my hips away from him so he&#39;s doing his best to suck me back in but eventually I&#39;m able to make some space standing up he clearly likes his hands clasped around my knees honestly pretty solid control here but I&#39;m able to free that right leg turning back into him this time I go back to the fundamentals framing on the head double my foot to the outside and then drive my forehead into his after a little bit of Blood Sweat and beers yoink that sucker back we also hit a little round with a subscriber so um subscribe or I&#39;ll he&#39;ll hook you up I&#39;m normally is Chill I just get high before class you know perhaps I&#39;m wrong this does seem to be a pretty normal start to around and here we have the attempted Lachlan Guile&#39;s foot lock entry but you know your boy has been around [\u00a0__\u00a0] knew it so I&#39;m gonna defend the footlock but he does a nice job coming up to secure the top position and I&#39;m gonna pop off to the side cutting an angle and getting the top position for myself he&#39;s gonna pull closed guard and hit a nice little flower Suite to keep him from popping up into mounts I&#39;m gonna trap his right leg in my half guard you can&#39;t really see because of the cameraman but I&#39;m able to wiggle myself into full guard You&#39;re Gonna Pop onto our side and play some of that passive guard try to save a little bit of energy if he wants to push the pace looking for an over underpass right as he steps over imma hook his leg and try to belly down the scramble is known as the funk now this position is giving me some Brokeback Mountain Vibes so I&#39;m gonna find a way to get out of it little transition to the back I&#39;m gonna grab the wrist I&#39;m Gonna Get Away now he&#39;s gonna start playing some open guard which I am totally cool with here I&#39;m using my needs kind of shove his legs off to the side he&#39;s gonna try to go for some of that Eddie Bravo half guard but I&#39;m wise to it and wiggle my way out he&#39;s gonna pop into turtle and tries to sit in into guard but I have his arm trap so I go with him looking for a crucifix gonna pop himself up so I&#39;m gonna bail on the crucifix and secure the top position I&#39;m just gonna ride it out here trying to conserve some of that stamina bar something I like to do here instead of forcing my hooks in is kind of pull them off to the side he&#39;s gonna force him to work harder than me in order to just get his base back and in this case it gives me his back that would be cool if we could get a nice textbook finish here but I don&#39;t read books he&#39;s gonna peel that bottom leg and try to pop out so I&#39;m just gonna follow him up staying behind him I&#39;m gonna use my hand to chop out his base and boom slide that hook in roll through take the back now he&#39;s doing a good job here of keeping his way over my underhook which is making it a pain for me to move anyway so he keeps on going for my foot trying some sort of Escape so I decide I&#39;m gonna throw my leg over grabbing my own shin and then rotating to the other side from here we&#39;re both fighting over my feet for whatever reason he also has my right foot trapped in between his I&#39;m able to make enough space to lock up a triangle crank on that arm and get the getting sick zero out of 10 don&#39;t recommended okay so when you&#39;re this tired you got two options one of them obviously taking a round off and the other one is rolling with a Savage Brown bow whose Jiu Jitsu is cracked like a hazelnut I&#39;ll let you decide which one I pick so I&#39;m gonna start by sitting down I&#39;m gonna grab a hold of that leg looking for some half guard now he&#39;s thinking about a guillotine but since I&#39;ve got that leg trapped there&#39;s really no threat so he&#39;s gonna bail on that I&#39;m gonna grab his legs looking for a pass this is kind of weird so I&#39;m gonna spin into him he almost takes my back but we end up in closed guard and this son of a gun hits me with that UFC one hoist Gracie ass triangle imma pull a little chaosun in defense because you know what great minds we think alike you can see my face turn in all colors here I&#39;m trying to make some space with these legs like a black hole he pulls me back in and honestly it&#39;s probably gonna be a little too chilly for your boy in Valhalla so I&#39;m just gonna tap here you can tell by my droopy posture that my stamina bar is on empty he&#39;s gonna go for a double leg I don&#39;t even try to fight it little Hail Mary triangle attack he&#39;s just gonna stand up but that gives me the space to stand up as well I don&#39;t like being on the bottom when I&#39;m this tired gonna go for a shot and then pull single X gonna try to hip in for the sweep and then switches to the outside usually that all the cool kids are doing these days I&#39;ve got his leg in my armpit so we&#39;re gonna have this little Mexican standoff until I decide now I don&#39;t like this I&#39;m gonna run away you want to hear something crazy people think that Jiu Jitsu is boring to watch we have as a scuffed flying arm bar attempt who&#39;s gonna throw me back in that single outside usually again I&#39;m not really feeling the vibe here so when he moves I pull my legs out little pitter patter until I pop a squat for the high crotch she may have been going for a flying triangle here but we get a clean little scoop I&#39;m thinking about that pass but then I give him space he&#39;s gonna pop up so I&#39;m thinking about that head but no he&#39;s gonna go for a little drop double tripping out the leg I&#39;m looking to turn away from him making some space but he&#39;s too quick with it just sitting in taking my back and he&#39;s using the comora to control my upper body so he can throw in his hooks and he&#39;s gonna use that lanky frame of his to put me in this body triangle uh position I have never been here before in the business this is something that we call uncomfortable looking for a little arm triangle goes for the spinaruski and that is the end of the round remember how I said I was tired before that round now I&#39;m dead [Music] strength and conditioning I view it as homework and let&#39;s be real most Jiu Jitsu guys are getting a big old F me included you know a lot of Fitness influencers they like to come out here in nature not how you make a six-pack but it&#39;s very aesthetic me I&#39;m just a cheap ass I don&#39;t want to pay 24.99 to get a Planet Fitness membership so I&#39;m gonna make do with this win Sprints tree tree [Music] well that hurts don&#39;t let yourself fall out of shape can&#39;t even talk because I&#39;m out of breath fingertips somebody put a counter up I can&#39;t do it oh yeah damn that&#39;s only 30. I have fallen from Grace anyways guys that&#39;s it for the video be sure to check out our merch I&#39;m gonna go [Music] need some Pokemon pretty good see you guys in a couple weeks take care [Music]"

      "subtitles": "this is a bodybuilder and this is a brown belt that&#39;s me actually but this bodybuilder is cheating let me explain this is where you take grease and just put it all over your body now in Jiu Jitsu it&#39;s seen as cheating and dirty but is it actually all that it&#39;s made out to be where are all these black belts whining do they just need to get good well that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna find out today I&#39;m gonna be rolling with three white belts ranging from small to massive and we&#39;re gonna see just how much of a difference a little bit of Grease can make yeah honestly this was a terrible idea [Music] thank you [Music] this part of the video is to set a groundwork of what should happen it&#39;s all these rounds nobody is greased up it&#39;s going to give us an accurate representation of the normal outcome [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] it&#39;s time to get to the exciting bit where we Lube these boys up with my certified cream and see what kind of advantage that gives up now what I may struggle with here a little bit especially with our bigger friend Nikki Rod at home is not being able to grab a hold of him because with bigger boys it&#39;s important to be able to grab a hold of them so that you can shove them off to the side and get behind them you don&#39;t really want to be going face to face with somebody of that stature first up is the homeboy Justin who is a white though he&#39;s been trading for a hot second but he&#39;s specked more into that fisting than the hugging aspect of martial arts he&#39;s arching his back here which gives me a decent grip on his head and I sit and almost sweeping him over my head as he pops up I go for that sweet front headlock sliding my right arm under his armpit to lock up a dark choke again he&#39;s making this easy on me by arching his back as opposed to Jeff Chan in this clip where he&#39;s giving me that big shoulder treatment keeping me from getting a solid grip he&#39;s gonna try to pull his head out of it but since I&#39;ve got a decent choke hold I&#39;m able to force him back to the mat and then step on over into mound from this position it&#39;s um yeah it&#39;s not fun and he&#39;s gonna tap out after fighting it for a second [Music] let&#39;s go [Music] okay so here we&#39;ve got Brandon who has been training for two months he&#39;s a white belt now you may think this is not fair considering I&#39;ve got the size and the experience on him but he is from Florida so um yeah get rebuttal so he&#39;s tried to pass me and we&#39;ve kind of fallen into this triangled choke but with no arm I need is kind of like taking a shower because it rarely happens but when it does feels a little weird anyways don&#39;t ask me how to finish this because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing here how&#39;s my balls taste [Music] so let&#39;s talk a little strategy now I generally like to start off my rules with a little bit of hand stuff I&#39;ve seen this out here I&#39;m going to be grabbing a hold of nothing but sweaty Palms mom&#39;s spaghetti go in for the head as opposed to the hands and arms it seems to be the better play here notice how I&#39;m going for this Muay Thai clinch almost like a kick boxer not only is the head a much bigger thing I can grab a hold of but this long sleeve rash guard has more surface area to latch onto giving me more grippiness oh where did I get this rash guard you ask good question that&#39;s where today&#39;s sponsor comes into play xmarshall.com you already know X Marshall is a jiu jitsu brand one thing I like about X Marshall is the premium quality on all of their gears is that any of that Walmart quality that&#39;s going to come apart into heel hooks they also have some pretty cool designs I like this one it reminds me of your mom they have just released this new gym bag which is just the right size to put in all your gear but it&#39;s not going to be a cluttering up the whole house also you gotta peep the new shorts 2.0 which are honestly some of the comfiest shorts that I&#39;ve ever worn xmarshall.com there&#39;s a link down below that&#39;s going to get you 10 off your next purchase with code Jedi now let&#39;s get back to the video anyways last time on Dragon Ball Z I had just gone in for a double Leg Takedown Brandon puts me in this arm in Guillotine but because my weight&#39;s over his shoulders he&#39;s really in no position to finish it however this was the first position I really started feeling the effects of greasy oh he&#39;s greased the [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah I&#39;m not breaking the script man you can see by the way he&#39;s grabbing his hands together there&#39;s nothing really crazy he&#39;s not really doing anything crazy right a simple fact that his hands are all greased up it&#39;s just giving me the hardest time of digging my fingers in there to pull them apart and if I&#39;m having trouble with uh sloppy Guillotine just imagine how dangerous something like a rear naked choke would be so far I&#39;m doing it better than I thought I was gonna do but there&#39;s still two more levels before we&#39;re out of the woods oil glazed and deep fried let&#39;s see if I&#39;ve got the chef and skills to cook up uh not so lean beef patty I want to get my grips inside of his because he&#39;s bigger than me and I just said that so that he&#39;s trying the same on me like I said I would like my grips to be inside of his this would give me priority and going for takedowns and pulling guard but he decides to use his head to fight back for control so far the Grecian isn&#39;t too much of an issue but I am being a little predictable Standing Tall and constantly going for that clinch he&#39;s able to scoop my leg pushing me back up against the fence he gets a nice lateral drop that definitely caught me off guard I didn&#39;t know they were teaching those at the squat rack now it is a little difficult to Triangle a big boy but it&#39;s like they say big boy Schmidt boy yes I knew it was a bad idea but I did not expect this snatched himself out of that choke so hard that he literally swept himself as I step over into side control he&#39;s moving hither and vither goes for a little clamp down on my forehead but he&#39;s trying to push me away with his hands instead of framing with his forearms so all I need to do is just move around to take away his angle of attack here he has a good idea by breeding both his hands together unfortunately he&#39;s pulling me close to him instead of pushing me away which is just making things worse yeah so breathing when your body goes into fight or flight something that a lot of newer Grapplers struggle with myself included when I first started but the power of editing Ricky has rested up and we&#39;re ready for our final match as you can see I&#39;m sticking to that tie clinch because it does seem to be my best bet and you can also do cool stuff like throw a knee and throw some punches my first move this round is looking to dive on his leg he&#39;s gonna use his head as a barrier pulling his leg away but is open for a triangle choke I know I&#39;m zero for two on the triangle but I can feel the Good Vibes we&#39;re gonna get this one boys I don&#39;t like triangles anymore next big moment coming up [Music] so what happened there is I went for an arm drag to inside trip he&#39;s able to free his leg and he uses this grip nicely to pull himself up now I think that greasing made a small difference here and I&#39;ll tell you why not the fact that he was able to pull his leg out and then sprawl on the takedown was when I went for the arm drag the arm drag is one of my best moves and I definitely felt a noticeable difference in the control I have which put me a little out of whack on the takedown which allowed him to defend it like I said small difference but on a move like this that can be everything nice of him circling to the back going to take my back as I roll again I&#39;m having a little difficulty breaking apart these greasy hands but since my hips are far from his once I break the grip I&#39;m able to turn into him now this is a tight head loss it&#39;s not really threatening with a choke but it&#39;s too tight for me to just get out of without giving up side control you can see he&#39;s trying to roll me over my head which is why I&#39;m trying to Anchor my way far off to the side here I switch my hips making his grip on my hip pop off he&#39;s doing a good job framing so I can&#39;t be too quick and go in for a sub I throw my arm over here thinking of a Kimura but he knows to turn to his side trying to agree space here he grabs my arm and tries to stick my head down under again because where my arm is I&#39;m able to circle around locking up a dark stroke a little squeeze and that&#39;s all she wrote honestly I was expecting greasing to make a slightly bigger difference than it did today obviously the fact that I rolled with white belts it plays a part so if you guys are interested let me know I&#39;ll do the black belt version of this video and also if you have any experience with greasing it let me know down in the comments below I&#39;m super curious remember guys gaslighting isn&#39;t real you&#39;re just overreacting"
