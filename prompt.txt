Still, most people don\u2019t realize that this federal district is also one of the most complex and productive local economies globally.\nIn this video, we dive deep into the fascinating economics of Washington D.C.. How its strange status fuels a massive local economy, and why calls for it to become a state are intensifying. How its wealth paradoxically creates some of the worst inequality in the U.S. We\u2019ll also explore how the unique structure of D.C. skews its economic measurements and what would happen if it gained independence as a state.\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@EconomiaExplicada-cz7zi\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #Surfshark #WashingtonDC \n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Charles Youngs, Jeromy Johnson\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\njenni himelic, Tarun B, Ernest Hua, Michael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Robert Abraham, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Frank Soltero, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00e9ne, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Shane Wailes, Igor Bazarny\n\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJulian Gilyadov, Eric, Larry Brown, Rudy Salazar, Bill Calkins, Per von Zweigbergk, Malleus Flavus, Backartoffel, Andy Giesen, Christopher Kastensn, Aryan, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, URtheOneNemo, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Jason, Jamie Costello, Leah Klearman, PsOFa, Abel, Randall Sylvia, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Kieran VR, Thomas Davenport, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joe Ryan, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Karan Mehta, ToGER, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

Enter coupon code ECONOMICS for 4 months EXTRA at https://surfshark.com/economics\n\n\nExploring the incredible transformation of the Persian Gulf from a collection of small fishing villages to the global epicenter of oil-fueled opulence. Cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh have risen from the sands with grand visions of becoming world-class business and tourist destinations. But is this meteoric rise sustainable, or just a facade built on dwindling oil reserves? We delve into the ambitious projects, the looming challenges, and the critical question of what happens when the oil runs out. Will these cities thrive in a post-oil world, or are they destined to become relics of a forgotten boom?\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@EconomiaExplicada-cz7zi\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #Surfshark #PersianGulf \n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Charles Youngs, Jeromy Johnson\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nJenni himelic, Tarun B, Ernest Hua, Michael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Robert Abraham, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Frank Soltero, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00e9ne, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Shane Wailes, Igor Bazarny\n\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJulian Gilyadov, Eric, Larry Brown, Rudy Salazar, Bill Calkins, Per von Zweigbergk, Malleus Flavus, Backartoffel, Andy Giesen, Christopher Kastensn, Aryan, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, URtheOneNemo, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Jason, Jamie Costello, Leah Klearman, PsOFa, Abel, Randall Sylvia, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Kieran VR, Thomas Davenport, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joe Ryan, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Karan Mehta, ToGER, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Interest applies on cash in an investment account. Terms apply.\n\nIn 2006, Spain's economy was booming, experiencing unparalleled growth since the turn of the millennium. With per capita output more than doubling in just six years, some economists predicted that Spain could surpass Germany in per capita income within five years, positioning itself as a central power in Europe.\nThe real estate sector thrived, with agents becoming local celebrities and tradespeople in high demand. However, this growth was unsustainable. The global financial crisis (GFC) and the Eurozone crisis abruptly ended debt-fueled expansion. Nearly two decades later, Spain's economy remains weaker than in 2007. High unemployment, stagnated economic activity, and persistent debt struggles paint a grim picture.\nSpain's story serves as a cautionary tale. This raises critical questions: What fueled Spain's rapid economic growth? What led to its dramatic downfall?

      "description": "Go to the link: https://imprintapp.com/Economics_explained_LIB to get 20% off an annual membership\n\n2016 was supposed to mark Brazil's rise as an economic superpower. The country saw rapid growth in industries, surpassing India and Italy, and nearing France and the UK in economic output. Improvements in healthcare, education, and political stability painted a promising picture.\n\nBut by 2016, the dream was shattered. The Rio Olympics, intended to showcase Brazil's success, became a global embarrassment. Delayed construction, waste-filled arenas, and the event's high costs bankrupted the city, leading to strikes by unpaid public servants. Instead of highlighting achievements, the Olympics exposed Brazil's challenges.\n\nSince its peak, Brazil's GDP has nearly halved, erasing progress made in the 2000s. Corruption scandals and political instability further hinder its recovery.\n\nThis video explores how Brazil became a fast-growing economy, why it collapsed, and if it can reclaim its former success. Could Brazil rise again?\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@EconomiaExplicada-cz7zi\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #Brazil #Imprint \n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Charles Youngs, Jeromy Johnson\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\njenni himelic, Tarun B, Ernest Hua, Michael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Robert Abraham, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Frank Soltero, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00e9ne, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Shane Wailes, Igor Bazarny\n\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJulian Gilyadov, Eric, Larry Brown, Rudy Salazar, Bill Calkins, Per von Zweigbergk, Malleus Flavus, Backartoffel, Andy Giesen, Christopher Kastensn, Aryan, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, URtheOneNemo, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Jason, Jamie Costello, Leah Klearman, PsOFa, Abel, Randall Sylvia, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Kieran VR, Thomas Davenport, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joe Ryan, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Karan Mehta, ToGER, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

      "description": "Take your personal data back with Incogni! Use code ECONOMICS at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/ECONOMICS\n\nFor decades, hosting the Olympics has been seen as a prestigious opportunity to showcase a nation's success. However, history shows that these events often coincide with economic challenges. Russia hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics, facing economic decline shortly after. Brazil's economy stagnated following the 2016 Rio Olympics, and China's growth slowed during the 2022 Winter Olympics. With France facing economic tensions ahead of its upcoming Olympics and Australia slated to host in 2032, it's worth questioning whether these prestigious events are predictors of economic downturns.

      "description": "Sign up and download for FREE: https://grammarly.com/economics07\n\nHawaii, the last state to join the USA, is renowned not just for its pivotal role in military operations and its allure as a top tourist destination, but also for its significant economic contributions on a global scale. Despite its modest size and remote location, the Hawaiian Islands boast an economic output rivaling countries like Bulgaria and Ecuador. This video delves into how Hawaii has carved out this economic niche, presenting a unique case study that challenges conventional measures of prosperity.\n\nWhile for many, Hawaii represents the perfect surfing getaway or a strategic naval base, the reality for its residents is a daily life marked by unique economic challenges. The state grapples with some of the highest living costs in the world, lacking the high-paying jobs that usually justify such expenses. From costly day-to-day necessities influenced by its isolation and tourist appeal to critical lapses in economic policy, this video examines the underlying issues that could be improved almost immediately\u2014if there was a political will to address them.\n\nIs it really just the price of living in paradise? This video questions whether these economic challenges can be managed without giving the state an unfair advantage and explores the potential consequences of neglecting these issues.

      "title": "Is Ireland's Economy a Scam?",
      "description": "https://www.trading212.com/join/EE and get a free random fractional share worth up to \u20ac100! Terms apply.\n\nWelcome to Ireland, a nation with two contrasting economic realities. On the surface, Ireland's economy appears as one of the world\u2019s richest, only behind Luxembourg in the IMF rankings, surpassing global economic leaders like Switzerland and the USA. But delve deeper, and you discover a more complex narrative.\n\nFor much of its history, Ireland has grappled with severe poverty and economic instability. Yet, the past two decades have painted a picture of unprecedented wealth, presenting Ireland as the richest major economy on paper. This fairytale, however, is powered by what many would call creative accounting, rather than a genuine economic revolution.\n\nIn this video, we explore the dichotomy between Ireland's 'make-believe' economy\u2014fueled by offshore trillions and favorable tax laws\u2014and its 'real' economy, composed of hard-working individuals and traditional businesses. We delve into how these two facets interact, the benefits of being a business haven comparable to New York or Singapore, and the inherent risks of building prosperity on precarious financial strategies.\n\nJoin us as we unpack the intricate dance between Ireland\u2019s enticing tax policies and its real economic substance, evaluating both the high stakes and the high gains of this fascinating economic setup. What does this mean for the future of Ireland\u2019s economy?\n\n #EconomicsExplained #Ireland  #Trading212 \n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@EconomiaExplicada-cz7zi\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Charles Youngs, Jeromy Johnson.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nErnest Hua, Michael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Robert Abraham, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Frank Soltero, David Poliakoff, Jay Eno, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, jill hoffman, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Shane Wailes, Igor Bazarny\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nPer von Zweigbergk, Malleus Flavus, Backartoffel, Andy Giesen, Christopher Kastensmidt, Aryan, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, Derrick Yowell, BUBBA CONWAY, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Dragan Alexandru, Jason, Jamie Costello, Leah Klearman, Klaus Clemens, Ps0Fa, Abel, Randall Sylvia, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Brian Jackson, Istvan P, Kieran VR, Leonid Sorokoumov, Thomas Davenport, Nicholas Luchetta, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, John Issitt, Joe Ryan, Patrick Staight, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Karan Mehta, roGER, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

There are, as always, a lot of factors to consider as to why that is the case, but recently Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson from MIT have released a study detailing the surprising bigger factors in why Africa still struggles to build wealth despite massive amounts of incoming aid and charity work trying to improve the lives of people there.

Canadian cities are in such a small area of the country's landmass and housing construction has not kept up with the population, so housing prices have skyrocketed. Canada now finds itself in a bit of a population trap, where they can't afford to keep bringing in more people and put even more strain on housing, but they also can't afford not to.\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia_Explicada\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #canadaeconomy #operabrowser \n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Jeromy Johnson.\n\nELITE CLASS\nCharles Youngs.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nMichael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Adrian Bellomo, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Stephanie Roth, Frank Soltero, David Poliakoff, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00eane, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, jill hoffman, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Kib Bibens-LeFebvre, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Igor Bazarny.\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJustin Thiele, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, Derrick Yowell, DionysusLin, BUBBA CONWAY, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Dragan Alexandru, Tenebrion, Jason, Alex Wong, Robert Abraham, Jamie Costello, Rick Van Velden, Leah Klearman, Bacongravy, Klaus Clemens, Ps0Fa, Abel, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Brian Jackson, Istvan P, Leonid Sorokoumov, Thomas Davenport, Nicholas Luchetta, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joshua White, John Issitt, Joe Ryan, Patrick Staight, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Andrew Baartz, Jim Kirker, Karan Mehta, roGER, Marton Csikos, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

This country is a complete military dictatorship, and has been called the North Korea of Africa. There are no free markets. No trading partners. Their debt to GDP ratio runs very high for one reason only: their country is in a critical region of the world for international shipping. But life really couldn't be much worse in Eritrea.\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia_Explicada\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #MyHeritage\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Jeromy Johnson.\n\nELITE CLASS\nCharles Youngs.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nMichael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Adrian Bellomo, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Stephanie Roth, Frank Soltero, David Poliakoff, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00eane, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, jill hoffman, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Kib Bibens-LeFebvre, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Igor Bazarny.\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJustin Thiele, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, Derrick Yowell, DionysusLin, BUBBA CONWAY, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Dragan Alexandru, Tenebrion, Jason, Alex Wong, Robert Abraham, Jamie Costello, Rick Van Velden, Leah Klearman, Bacongravy, Klaus Clemens, Ps0Fa, Abel, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Brian Jackson, Istvan P, Leonid Sorokoumov, Thomas Davenport, Nicholas Luchetta, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joshua White, John Issitt, Joe Ryan, Patrick Staight, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Andrew Baartz, Jim Kirker, Karan Mehta, roGER, Marton Csikos, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

A disregard for the drawbacks of production like waste, pollution and inequality are often cited by people who want capitalism to be replaced by social democracy, communism or even anarchy. But even communist countries like the USSR and China have reluctantly returned to capitalism.

While many other countries can learn from France's strong protection for workers' rights, at the moment this has made France a very uncompetitive country with some of the worst brain drain across the EU. Why work in France for lower wages when they can make so much more in the UK, Germany and the US. Is France stuck at just being the place with fancy handbags and perfumes, or can it change it's economy to stay internationally competitive?\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia_Explicada\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #FranceEconomy\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Jeromy Johnson.\n\nELITE CLASS\nCharles Youngs.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nMichael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Adrian Bellomo, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Stephanie Roth, Frank Soltero, David Poliakoff, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00eane, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, jill hoffman, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Kib Bibens-LeFebvre, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Igor Bazarny.\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJustin Thiele, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, Derrick Yowell, DionysusLin, BUBBA CONWAY, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Dragan Alexandru, Tenebrion, Jason, Alex Wong, Robert Abraham, Jamie Costello, Rick Van Velden, Leah Klearman, Bacongravy, Klaus Clemens, Ps0Fa, Abel, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Brian Jackson, Istvan P, Leonid Sorokoumov, Thomas Davenport, Nicholas Luchetta, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joshua White, John Issitt, Joe Ryan, Patrick Staight, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Andrew Baartz, Jim Kirker, Karan Mehta, roGER, Marton Csikos, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.

      "description": "Go to https://GiveWell.org/EconomicsExplained to donate. First-time donors who say they came from Economics Explained will get their first $100 matched.\n\nAustralia's biggest export is natural resources, and as we have talked about on the channel many times, this isn't always a great thing for an economy. Resources don't provide much value to the local economy, especially in Australia where mines are thousands of miles from residential centres, and they don't employ all that many people for the massive wealth they create. Australia lags far behind technological centres like the US, but somehow has a strong economy. How has it done this and what can we learn from a country that just digs holes and builds homes?\n\nThis video was made possible by our Patreon community! \u2764\ufe0f\nSee new videos early, participate in exclusive Q&As, and more!\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\nCheck out our other channels \u25b6\ufe0f\nEpic Economics @EconomicsIsEpic\nContext Matters @Context.Matters\n\nAnd our Language Channels \u2192 \nWirtschaftsWissen (GER) - https://www.youtube.com/@wirtschafts-wissen/\nL'\u00c9conomie Expliqu\u00e9e (FRE) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economie-Expliquee\nEconomia Explicada (POR) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia_Explicada\nEconom\u00eda Explicada (SPA) - https://www.youtube.com/@Economia-Explicada\n\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 (AR) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2e5T8HRatVL05rhhhqRkXA\n\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u8a71 (JP) - https://www.youtube.com/@KeizaiKaiwa\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Enquiries \u2192 hello@economicsexplained.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to EE on Spotify! \ud83d\udc49 https://open.spotify.com/show/5TFVUEJnYLOCmmfaDNHaM2\nAlso on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you listen!\n\n#EconomicsExplained #EconomyofAustralia #GiveWell\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nECONOMICS EXPLAINED IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR PATREON COMMUNITY \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude4f\nSupport EE by becoming a Patron today! \ud83d\udc49 https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained\n\n\ud83d\udc51 ROYALTY CLASS \ud83d\udc51\nJuan Benet\n\nUPPER CLASS\nValkmit, Randall, Jeromy Johnson.\n\nELITE CLASS\nCharles Youngs.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS\nMichael Wakim, Pineapples&bricks, Adrian Bellomo, Peter Wesselius, Michael Ling, Stephanie Roth, Frank Soltero, David Poliakoff, Jay Eno, Gr\u00e9goire Duch\u00eane, Sophie G, Brett Jubinville, Anthony Roberts, jill hoffman, Nathan Ngumi, JKH, Post Apocalyptic In Missouri, Laor Glukhovsky, Kib Bibens-LeFebvre, Forodon, Paul Ashworth, Wendover Productions, Andrew Harrison, Igor Bazarny.\n\nMIDDLE CLASS\nJustin Thiele, William Sherlock, Gerhardus, Derrick Yowell, DionysusLin, BUBBA CONWAY, Chris, Brian, Vladimir Zotov, Seth, Dragan Alexandru, Tenebrion, Jason, Alex Wong, Robert Abraham, Jamie Costello, Rick Van Velden, Leah Klearman, Bacongravy, Klaus Clemens, Ps0Fa, Abel, Eric Slimko, Empyre18, Brian Jackson, Istvan P, Leonid Sorokoumov, Thomas Davenport, Nicholas Luchetta, Kim Brand, Ted Marcy, Joshua White, John Issitt, Joe Ryan, Patrick Staight, Wees Kendall, Shane Guthrie, Andrew Baartz, Jim Kirker, Karan Mehta, roGER, Marton Csikos, Randy Cleary, Arjan, Liubov Zvereva, Michael D.
