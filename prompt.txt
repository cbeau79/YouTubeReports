            - Classify the content using the lists in <content_categories> and <video_formats>:
                1. content_categories: Select up to three categories from <Content Categories> that best describe the channel, ordered by relevance.
                2. video_formats: Identify the primary video format(s) from <Video Formats>. List up to three formats, in order of prevalence, if multiple are used frequently.
                3. content_category_justification: Explain in 2–3 sentences why you chose these categories and formats, specifying which content elements informed your selection. 
                Include this classification in the categorisation section of <return_json_template>.
        Tone: Write in a clear, structured, and engaging style that appeals to YouTube content creators. Be constructive yet direct, especially when identifying areas for improvement.
        Other Instructions:
            - Highlight specific strengths and areas of improvement.
            - Support insights and recommendations with concrete data.
            - Provide thoughtful, detailed answers, and avoid rushing to conclusions.
        Report Structure: 
            1. Executive Summary
                - Content summary: Summarise the channel’s content strategy and briefly assess whether it is succeeding or struggling.
                - Channel hosts and personalities: Describe the hosts if they are mentioned in the data. If not, indicate this. Incorporate any relevant external knowledge.
                - Channel prominence and competitive landscape: Analyse the channel’s success or limitations in its niche.
            2. Key Metrics
                Viewership: List average and median views. Review view counts, likes, and comments for different video types, identifying successful formats or inconsistencies.
                Top-performing content category and video format: Based on <Content Categories> and <Video Formats>, identify the best-performing category and format, using series or franchise names where applicable.
                Publishing frequency: Note the channel’s average weekly uploads and compare with similar channels, listing the primary competitors.
            3. Trends:
                - Identify three notable content trends in <channel_data>, with a paragraph for each.
            4. Oratory Style:
                - Using subtitle data, provide a three-paragraph analysis of the channel’s oratory style, each paragraph with a sub-heading. Include relevant quotes from subtitles (2–3 sentences each) to illustrate your points.
            5. Recommendations:
                - Offer three growth recommendations, with data-backed reasoning for each. Focus on strategies for rapid growth, either by refining the current approach or pivoting as needed. Reference strategies used by competitors where applicable.
            6. Limitations:

the maps I probably do not need to go into the fact that Maps like need to go into the fact that Maps like need to go into the fact that Maps like this make it seem like the whole country this make it seem like the whole country this make it seem like the whole country votes Trump but importantly land does votes Trump but importantly land does votes Trump but importantly land does not vote there's only one reason to make not vote there's only one reason to make not vote there's only one reason to make a map like this it's to make it look a map like this it's to make it look a map like this it's to make it look like people who live in cities don't like people who live in cities don't like people who live in cities don't matter but there is a reason to make a matter but there is a reason to make a matter but there is a reason to make a map like this but it still has this same map like this but it still has this same map like this but it still has this same problem which is why some places use problem which is why some places use problem which is why some places use variations to show the actual electoral variations to show the actual electoral variations to show the actual electoral power of each state but the main thing power of each state but the main thing power of each state but the main thing these baps are trying to do is not show these baps are trying to do is not show these baps are trying to do is not show you who voted how they're trying to tell you who voted how they're trying to tell you who voted how they're trying to tell you who won the election the president you who won the election the president you who won the election the president of the United States is elected by the of the United States is elected by the of the United States is elected by the states not by the citizens so we look at states not by the citizens so we look at states not by the citizens so we look at the states not the citizens but still we the states not the citizens but still we the states not the citizens but still we look at these maps and we think they are look at these maps and we think they are look at these maps and we think they are representing humans rather than States representing humans rather than States representing humans rather than States now if we actually want to know how now if we actually want to know how now if we actually want to know how people voted we need a map that shows people voted we need a map that shows people voted we need a map that shows color gradients because because trust me color gradients because because trust me color gradients because because trust me as a person who lives in a red State I as a person who lives in a red State I as a person who lives in a red State I don't like that my existence gets don't like that my existence gets don't like that my existence gets completely ignored by electoral Maps but completely ignored by electoral Maps but completely ignored by electoral Maps but then maybe we also still have to correct then maybe we also still have to correct then maybe we also still have to correct for population which makes Maps look for population which makes Maps look for population which makes Maps look super weird but I also feel like we need super weird but I also feel like we need super weird but I also feel like we need to talk about these Maps these vote to talk about these Maps these vote to talk about these Maps these vote swing Maps which have become all the swing Maps which have become all the swing Maps which have become all the rage because they do show something rage because they do show something rage because they do show something important but the important thing they important but the important thing they important but the important thing they show is very specific and not entirely show is very specific and not entirely show is very specific and not entirely what it seems these Maps tell you the what it seems these Maps tell you the what it seems these Maps tell you the 2020 to 2024 percentage difference 2020 to 2024 percentage difference 2020 to 2024 percentage difference between the spread between Republicans between the spread between

time but that's not necessarily last time but that's not necessarily true now if I'm thinking hard I might true now if I'm thinking hard I might true now if I'm thinking hard I might think oh well it could be that Donald think oh well it could be that Donald think oh well it could be that Donald Trump got the same number of votes but Trump got the same number of votes but Trump got the same number of votes but kamla Harris got fewer than Joe Biden kamla Harris got fewer than Joe Biden kamla Harris got fewer than Joe Biden but it could also mean that they both but it could also mean that they both but it could also mean that they both got fewer but Trump still increased his got fewer but Trump still increased his got fewer but Trump still increased his margin or they both got more and Trump margin or they both got more and Trump margin or they both got more and Trump increased his margin it only shows the increased his margin it only shows the increased his margin it only shows the percentage increase the margin no percentage increase the margin no percentage increase the margin no absolute numbers at all this also means absolute numbers at all this also means absolute numbers at all this also means that it still suffers from similar that it still suffers from similar that it still suffers from similar problems to electoral maps with a problems to electoral maps with a problems to electoral maps with a special one of its own which is that special one of its own which is that special one of its own which is that this is a county by county map which this is a county

      "description": "I think, for example, that pretty much every question about \"cancel culture\" is a question poorly phrased because \"cancel culture\" means at least 20 different things, from celebrities going to jail for sexual assault to viral \"karen\" videos. It's impossible to be right about cancel culture but very easy to have an opinion on it because every person has a different definition. It is a question, like the math test in the video, seemingly intentionally designed to create conflict. \n\nThere are so many mechanisms of how our disrupted world gets so messy and weird and bad, but the fact that it's much easier to argue about stuff when opinions are easy to form, and it's much easier to form easy opinions when questions are wrongly stated is actually new to me!!\n\nAlways learning!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Certainly that's very exciting, and it would be very cool if we could get some of those for, like, transportation and medicine and democracy, but instead, it's mostly a bunch of work of lots of individuals doing small things that ends up making the world better. I get very skeptical when big simple solutions are proposed to me, and I think you should as well.\n\nA lot of people have done great work showing that solar roads are a bad idea.

The authors of another paper were mislead, though it would have been easy not to be mislead because they're scientists.\n4. Peer review did not catch the stat because it was a background stat, not part of the papers methods or results which peer review doesn't spend much (if any) time on.\n5. News outlets did not investigate the source of the background stat and published it as if it were fact.\n6.

And it's hard to say that the people playing those politics haven't been well-rewarded for it, so honestly I'm not sure what we can do. \n\n41% of Americans live in a home with a gun, a percentage that rose quite a lot during the pandemic. We aren't going to ban guns in America. Some people might want that, but it doesn't matter because it is impossible. But there are lots of strategies we can put in place to actually make guns safer. Other countries have done it. The only thing standing in the way of us doing it in the US is wild, unfounded fears that are being manufactured and sold by people trying to consolidate their power. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

There are lots of reasons for him to back out of the deal as well, including the fact that, if he doesn't he becomes the bogeyman.

But I wanted to try to express that the people trying to restrict access to information and human rights do not speak for me or for all Christians. \n\nAlso: I made this video before the leak of the U.S. Supreme Court's apparent decision to overturn Roe.

      "description": "In which John tells the story of how he escaped the despair of feeling like nothing could ever be done about anything, and how in learning more, he became more optimistic about the future.\n\nSome other strategies for crossing the sad gap that stood out to me in comments to Hank's video:\n\n1. There is very little evil - Almost no one thinks they are evil, or that their beliefs or policies are malicious. If you had a different life, you'd have different values. \n\n2. Listen to the people who are working on solving the problem and research their past successes. There are many ways in which the world is better than it was a generation ago. Find the people who are helping to drive these successes and pay attention to them. Pay attention as well to the people who are calling out the problems we face in new ways that will help us to tackle them better.\n\n3. Connect with individuals: Building relationships is both a way to cross the sad gap (because you'll find that you're working/thinking/volunteering with people who are also trying to solve the same problems that are important to you) and a way to learn more deeply about the challenges you care about.\n\n4. Believe in the possibility of humanity. Look to the moments when we have shown real solidarity and taken meaningful steps to make the world suck less. Look to the way the people of Damascus responded to the plague, or the ways systems have been built to better serve our shared needs.\n\n5. You can only have one first priority: This is what inspired today's video!\n\n6. Be grateful for the work of others. On the problems you don\u2019t have time to interface with deeply, do not think \u201cthis problem will solve itself\u201d think \u201cthere are wonderful people who I trust to work on this.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

I don't know to what extent this is an artifact of the structure of people communicating and to what extent it is an artifact of the way the social internet is built. \n\nI also think that there are some people who think that The Sad Gap is the honorable, correct place to be. As if you are a bad person if you get out of the place where you only feel hopelessness and outrage. I am, frankly, OVER THAT. I think it's making things much worse. I never thought it was the right thing to do and the moment I realized that other people did, I got very worried. \n\nAnyway, it's taken me a long time to think about this stuff and articulate it and I am very curious about what other people think so please leave comments, I will be reading them voraciously. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

      "description": "In which John explores historical and political context to understand what caused the Russian government's invasion of Ukraine, and how we arrived at this awful now. There is a LOT of misinformation in comments, so why not read directly from SOURCES? But first, CORRECTIONS:\n\nThe official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian. \"National languages\" as a phrase was confusing. I should've just said that 30% of Ukrainians speak Russian as their first language. Also, the etymology of \"Ukraine\" is not settled as \"borderlands.\" Many Ukrainian linguists argue that the etymology of Ukraine comes from words meaning \"In My Land,\" not \"borderlands.\" Thirdly, I  misspelled Kyiv as Kiev. If I made further mistakes, let me know and I'll amend here.\n\nNow, SOURCES:\n\nPutin's claims that Ukraine never had \"real statehood\" have been stated in both essays and speeches. Here's some coverage of one such speech: https://time.com/6150046/ukraine-statehood-russia-history-putin/\n\nAnd a fact-check of the same speech: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/fact-checking-putins-speech-ukraine/\n\nIf you want to read Vladimir Putin's essay where he expounds his theory that Ukraine \"was created entirely by Russia,\" you can read Putin's meandering, surreal, ahistorical essay about it here: http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181 (This is an insecure site owned by the Kremlin so bear that in mind)\n\nThis article goes into far more detail about Putin's theory of Ukraine's illegitimacy than I could cover in the video: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/world/europe/putin-ukraine.html\n\nYou can learn about the Holodomor here: https://www.britannica.com/event/Holodomor or at this thoroughly researched wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor\n\nAnd about Stalin's forced deportation policies here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union\n\nPutin's reference to assault in the context of invading Ukraine: https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-macron-meeting-quote-obscene-lyrics-show-russia-ukraine-demands-2022-2\n\nThe 1991 Independence referendum results: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Ukrainian_independence_referendum\n\n\nHuge thanks to Rosianna Halse Rojas for editing the script and help sourcing images.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",
