having to make this decision and weren't expecting to on the field initially they expecting to on the field initially they expecting to on the field initially they believed that Ben White was closer than believed that Ben White was closer than believed that Ben White was closer than he actually was and they also weren't he actually was and they also weren't he actually was and they also weren't convinced that Evan neon would control convinced that Evan neon would control convinced that Evan neon would control the ball there's two things the V can do the ball there's two things the V can do the ball there's two things the V can do here to prove that the onfield ass was here to prove that the onfield ass was here to prove that the onfield ass was wrong firstly he can see that Ben White wrong firstly he can see that Ben White wrong firstly he can see that Ben White is a long way away he's not going to get is a long way away he's not going to get is a long way away he's not going to get into Evan neelson from that position I into Evan neelson from that position I into Evan neelson from that position I think I think we can see long way across think I think we can see long way across think I think we can see long way across the field Leon and then secondly they the field Leon and then secondly they the field Leon and then secondly they can see that David Ry is backing off and can see that David Ry is backing off and can see that David Ry is backing off and when the ball dies in front of Evan Leon when the ball dies in front of Evan Leon when the ball dies in front of Evan Leon even though it's some distance from goal even though it's some distance from goal even though it's some distance from goal he's going to get onto that ball he's he's going to get onto that ball he's he's going to get onto that ball he's going to have time to gain nice control going to have time to gain nice control going to have time to gain nice control just with a keeper to beat in fact just with a keeper to beat in fact just with a keeper to beat in fact actually in this situation the the fact actually in this situation the the fact actually in this situation the the fact that ball is slightly further away from that ball is slightly further away from that ball is slightly further away from goal helps him if this is further goal helps him if this is further goal helps him if this is further forward it might be a 50/50 between Rea forward it might be a 50/50 between Rea forward it might be a 50/50 between Rea and Evan Neel but it's not 50/50 because and Evan Neel but it's not 50/50 because and Evan Neel but it's not 50/50 because of that distance he's got to run into so of that distance he's got to run into so of that distance he's got to run into so for me a good intervention by the V for me a good intervention by the V for me a good intervention by the V clear and obvious error in not showing a clear and obvious error in not showing a clear and obvious error in not showing a red card on the field well we'll we'll red card on the field well we'll we'll red card on the field well we'll we'll take over the boxes we've just showed take over the boxes we've just showed take over the boxes we've just showed that Ben White from that angle is that Ben White from that angle is that Ben White from that angle is probably not going to recover as we as probably not going to recover as we as probably not going to recover as we as we run it on direction of ball you're we run it on direction of ball you're we run it on direction of ball you're right about Leandro right about Leandro right about Leandro trossard I would trossard I would trossard I would say this ball is is going more in that say this ball is is going more in that say this ball is is going more in that direction than maybe towards a Ben White direction than maybe towards a Ben White direction than maybe towards a Ben White or or somebody else so yeah I think I or or somebody else so yeah I think I or or somebody else so yeah I think I think you wanted to highlight the think you wanted to highlight the think you wanted to highlight the goalkeeper who goalkeeper who goalkeeper who is backing away from the incident was is backing away from the incident was is backing away from the incident was that was key I think that's important that was key I think that's important that was key I think that's important because if he's if he's charging out because if he's if he's charging out because if he's if he's charging out from an advanced position then it from an advanced position then it from an advanced position then it becomes a 50/50 foot race between him becomes a 50/50 foot race between him becomes a 50/50 foot race between him and EV neelson and if there is doubt if and EV neelson and if there is doubt if and EV neelson and if there is doubt if it is a foot race a 50/50 then we're it is a foot race a 50/50 then we're it is a foot race a 50/50 then we're just going to leave it as a yellow card just going to leave it as a yellow card just going to leave it as a yellow card on the field but because he's backing on the field but because he's backing on the field but because he's backing off and the ball dies nicely in front of off and the ball dies nicely in front of off and the ball dies nicely in front of Evan neelson there's not a lot of pace Evan neelson there's not a lot of pace Evan neelson there's not a lot of pace on it I think it's uh it's one that on it I think it's uh it's one that on it I think it's uh it's one that becomes then very clear yeah I I becomes then very clear yeah I I becomes then very clear yeah I I personally feel it's it's a little bit personally feel it's it's a little bit personally feel it's it's a little bit harsh and I know um I know you're harsh and I know um I know you're harsh and I know um I know you're talking criteria I know we're touching talking criteria I know we're touching talking criteria I know we're touching all of the of the moments I just think all of the of the moments I just think all of the of the moments I just think that he's just been caught out celba in that he's just been caught out celba in that he's just been caught out celba in that moment and the my reasoning is just that moment and the my reasoning is just that moment and the my reasoning is just that is that slight touch enough to have that is that slight touch enough to have that is that slight touch enough to have actually brought I nson down I think he actually brought I nson down I think he actually brought I nson down I think he could have continued if he'd have wanted could have continued if he'd have wanted could have continued if he'd have wanted and I think for a a mo a split second and I think for a a mo a split second and I think for a a mo a split second thought a split second reaction when thought a split second reaction when thought a split second reaction when you're that far away from go is my is my you're that far away from go is my is my you're that far away from go is my is my argument that we still don't know what argument that we still don't know what argument that we still don't know what was happening and I think Evan wanted was happening and I think Evan wanted was happening and I think Evan wanted the free kick does that ever does that the free kick does that ever does that the free kick does that ever does that ever come into your mind the fact that ever come into your mind the fact that ever come into your mind the fact that you think the striker went down too easy you think the striker went down too easy you think the striker went down too easy or it's a soft foul or the striker or it's a soft foul or the striker or it's a soft foul or the striker wanted the foul yeah yeah of course you wanted the foul yeah yeah of course you wanted the foul yeah yeah of course you have to look at the the actions of the have to look at the the actions of the have to look at the the actions of the defender first that's something we defender first that's something we defender first that's something we always do and then we look at the always do and then we look at the always do and then we look at the motivations of the attacker as well um motivations of the attacker as well um motivations of the attacker as well um we don't want to be fooled by a player we don't want to be fooled by a player we don't want to be fooled by a player going down who's not being not being going down who's not being not being going down who's not being not being fouled in in this situation there is a a fouled in in this situation there is a a fouled in in this situation there is a a tug by CBA um Evan eand goes down I I tug by CBA um Evan eand goes down I I tug by CBA um Evan eand goes down I I think that's okay for a foul I respect think that's okay for a foul I respect think that's okay for a foul I respect your opinion leam that you think it's a your opinion leam that you think it's a your opinion leam that you think it's a bit soft but I think there's enough here bit soft but I think there's enough here bit soft but I think there's enough here to give the foul and don't forget the to give the foul and don't forget the to give the foul and don't forget the referee on the field saw that as a foul referee on the field saw that as a foul referee on the field saw that as a foul and gave it so when it then goes to V and gave it so when it then goes to V and gave it so when it then goes to V the question the V is asking is is the the question the V is asking is is the the question the V is asking is is the award of a free kit clearly wrong well I award of a free kit clearly wrong well I award of a free kit clearly wrong well I think we'd agree that it's not clearly think we'd agree that it's not clearly think we'd agree that it's not clearly wrong you feel it's a little bit soft wrong you feel it's a little bit soft wrong you feel it's a little bit soft but I think you can also say that you but I think you can also say that you but I think you can also say that you understand why it's given uh and understand why it's given uh and understand why it's given uh and therefore the V will simply you know therefore the V will simply you know therefore the V will simply you know check that aspect and say that's fine check that aspect and say that's fine check that aspect and say that's fine that is not an error in terms of giving that is not an error in terms of giving that is not an error in terms of giving the foul not a

um for it to happen the next day um certainly close enough for us to be certainly close enough for us to be certainly close enough for us to be having this discussion one was a yellow having this discussion one was a yellow having this discussion one was a yellow one was a red you again are you one was a red you again are you one was a red you again are you satisfied with that yeah the two satisfied with that yeah the two satisfied with that yeah the two situations were compared they happened situations were compared they happened situations were compared they happened in the same in the same match round so in the same in the same match round so in the same in the same match round so those comparisons often do do happen uh those comparisons often do do happen uh those comparisons often do do happen uh in this situation again the onfield in this situation again the onfield in this situation again the onfield decision was yellow card for tossing um decision was yellow card for tossing um decision was yellow card for tossing um stopping a promising attack but the stopping a promising attack but the stopping a promising attack but the referee on the field felt this fell referee on the field felt this fell referee on the field felt this fell short of being Dogo uh because the ball short of being Dogo uh because the ball short of being Dogo uh because the ball is arcing away to the right on the other is arcing away to the right on the other is arcing away to the right on the other one it was going towards the center this one it was going towards the center this one it was going towards the center this one's going out towards where the one's going out towards where the one's going out towards where the assistant is that's one aspect another assistant is that's one aspect another assistant is that's one aspect another really key aspect for me is that Levi really key aspect for me is that Levi really key aspect for me is that Levi cwell is pretty close by this is a cwell is pretty close by this is a cwell is pretty close by this is a situation that's high up the field cwell situation that's high up the field cwell situation that's high up the field cwell has a lot of time to get back from a has a lot of time to get back from a has a lot of time to get back from a close position to J um and undoubtedly close position to J um and undoubtedly close position to J um and undoubtedly would have been able to impact the the would have been able to impact the the would have been able to impact the the obviousness of this situation I think so obviousness of this situation I think so obviousness of this situation I think so because of colwell's position being so because of colwell's position being so because of colwell's position being so much closer than for example Ben White much closer than for example Ben White much closer than for example Ben White was and the ball like bending out away was and the ball like bending out away was and the ball like bending out away from goal I think this Falls less than from goal I think this Falls less than from goal I think this Falls less than uh than obvious and I agree with the uh than obvious and I agree with the uh than obvious and I agree with the yellow card in this situation and it was yellow card in this situation and it was yellow card in this situation and it was correctly checked completed by the V see correctly checked completed by the V see correctly checked completed by the V see I I'm of the opinion that they're both I I'm of the opinion that they're both I I'm of the opinion that they're both very similar I feel that the touch of very similar I feel that the touch of very similar I feel that the touch of toson here is prolonged and there is a toson here is prolonged and there is a toson here is prolonged and there is a real intention to make sure he doesn't real intention to make sure he doesn't real intention to make sure he doesn't get away so that's where in my mind I'm get away so that's where in my mind I'm get away so that's where in my mind I'm thinking cbaa didn't really do much toen thinking cbaa didn't really do much toen thinking cbaa didn't really do much toen actually meant to bring him down there actually meant to bring him down there actually meant to bring him down there is an argument as as I agree that could is an argument

uh I think the main but oh man um the uh I think the main takeaway I don't know I got I got a takeaway I don't know I got I got a takeaway I don't know I got I got a couple I really like but the fact that couple I really like but the fact that couple I really like but the fact that the Thunder are rolling out this small the Thunder are rolling out this small the Thunder are rolling out this small ball lineup I thought was one of the ball lineup I thought was one of the ball lineup I thought was one of the most exciting things and I'm not sure if most exciting things and I'm not sure if most exciting things and I'm not sure if this was just directly correlated or it this was just directly correlated or it this was just directly correlated or it just happened but SG ended up having a just happened but SG ended up having a just happened but SG ended up having a career high 45 points which was also a career high 45 points which was also a career high 45 points which was also a little bit surprising that he hadn't little bit surprising that he hadn't little bit surprising that he hadn't gotten to that number before considering gotten to that number before considering gotten to that number before considering how many 30 plus point games he's had um how many 30 plus point games he's had um how many 30 plus point games he's had um so that was exciting and then Brandon so that was exciting and then Brandon so that was exciting and then Brandon Boston Jr he looks very legit um I think Boston Jr he looks very legit um I think Boston Jr he looks very legit um I think the most encouraging thing to me was the most encouraging thing to me was the most encouraging thing to me was that even when he wasn't hitting shots that even when he wasn't hitting shots that even when he wasn't hitting shots which was the case inas game after which was the case inas game after which was the case inas game after having a couple big scoring nights he having a couple big scoring nights he having a couple big scoring nights he was still productive like the 10 assists was still productive like the 10 assists was still productive like the 10 assists that was very surprising um and now with that was very surprising um and now with that was very surprising um and now with Jose Alvarado out for a while maybe Jose Alvarado out for a while maybe Jose Alvarado out for a while maybe we'll see more big assist Nights from we'll see more big assist Nights from we'll see more big assist Nights from him and Brandon him and Brandon him and Brandon Ingram yeah that's a good point um you

minutes you know he didn't shoot the minutes you know he didn't shoot the minutes you know he didn't shoot the ball well but you kind of expect that ball well but you kind of expect that ball well but you kind of expect that with the time off he's going to need with the time off he's going to need with the time off he's going to need some time to get the rust off but as some time to get the rust off but as some time to get the rust off but as soon as he can take on a full soon as he can take on a full soon as he can take on a full workload I think his stock is going to R workload I think his stock is going to R workload I think his stock is going to R dramatically out of out of need just dramatically out of out of need just dramatically out of out of need just because they really don't

roster because you look at that Portland roster he's essentially the only two guard they he's essentially the only two guard they he's essentially the only two guard they have on it um and that's a big reason have on it um and that's a big reason have on it um and that's a big reason why he jumped into the starting lineup why he jumped into the starting lineup why he jumped into the starting lineup like what his second game back you know like what his second game back you know like what his second game back you know he he replaced Denny ABIA so ABIA is he he replaced Denny ABIA so ABIA is he he replaced Denny ABIA so ABIA is kind of taking a hit in terms of fantasy kind of taking a hit in terms of fantasy kind of taking a hit in terms of fantasy value in minutes so I would not drop value in minutes so I would not drop value in minutes so I would not drop Shaden sharp for alar that much I'll say Shaden sharp for alar that much I'll say Shaden sharp for alar that much I'll say for for for sure yeah I think I would drop k so um sure yeah I think I would drop k so um sure yeah I think I would drop k so um he hasn't been what we expect him to be he hasn't been what we expect him to be he hasn't been what we expect him to be with the Thunder I think when they tra with the Thunder I think when they tra with the Thunder I think when they tra giddy for him the expectation was oh giddy for him the expectation was oh giddy for him the expectation was oh he's going to start but I guess that he's going to start but I guess that he's going to start but I guess that might I don't know it could be a number might I don't know it could be a number might I don't know it could be a number of factors like they're prioritizing the of factors like they're prioritizing the of factors like they're prioritizing the playoffs and having him healthy then playoffs and having him healthy then playoffs and having him healthy then because he hasn't been able to healthy because he hasn't been able to healthy because he hasn't been able to healthy in a while and then also maybe they in a while and then also maybe they in a while and then also maybe they didn't view the trade as oh we're didn't view the trade as oh we're didn't view the trade as oh we're getting this we're having to give up getting this we're having to give up getting this we're having to give up this former lottery pick it's you know this former lottery pick it's you know this former lottery pick it's you know they view Josh giddy as the negative they view Josh giddy as the negative they view Josh giddy as the negative asset that I think a lot of other people asset that I think a lot of other people asset that I think a lot of other people it was just kind of something to bring it was just kind of something to bring it was just kind of something to bring in a veteran um so he's played less than in a veteran um so he's played less than in a veteran um so he's played less than 20 minutes per game without chat in the 20 minutes per game without chat in the 20 minutes per game without chat in the last game he played less than 20 minutes last game he played less than 20 minutes last game he played less than 20 minutes yeah so yeah he just hasn't been great yeah so yeah he just hasn't been great yeah so yeah he just hasn't been great for fantasy and so I think it's fine to for fantasy and so I think it's fine to for fantasy and so I think it's fine to drop him for the upside of assar yeah drop him for the upside of assar yeah drop him for the upside of assar yeah I'd agree with that like you said he I'd agree with that like you said he I'd agree with that like you said he only played 20 minutes last night only played 20 minutes last night only played 20 minutes last night without chat that's a bit of a concern without chat that's a bit of a concern without chat that's a bit of a concern in terms of his fantasy value all right in terms of his fantasy value all right in terms of his fantasy value all right Steve on planet burner asks given the Steve on planet burner asks given the Steve on planet burner asks given the recent news on Chad hren what do do you recent news on Chad hren what do do you recent news on Chad hren what do do you think Haren Stein's value is at the moment I'm gonna look up how long moment I'm gonna look up how long moment I'm gonna look up how long hartenstein is out for that's what I was hartenstein is out for that's what I was hartenstein is out for that's what I was about to pull up too so I'll let you do about to pull up too so I'll let you do about to pull up too so I'll let you do that but I think that is kind of the that but I think that is kind of the that but I think that is kind of the biggest Factor because I don't remember biggest Factor because I don't remember biggest Factor because I don't remember it off the top of my head when he's it off the top of my head when he's it off the top of my head when he's supposed to return but I mean looks like supposed to return but I mean looks like supposed to return but I mean looks like it could be towards the end of this it could be towards the end of this it could be towards the end of this month he reevaluated in five to six month he reevaluated in five to six month he reevaluated in five to six weeks from October 17th weeks from October 17th weeks from October 17th so okay so like early December return so okay so like early December return so okay so like early December return which I think Chad is not going to be which I think Chad is not going to be which I think Chad is not going to be back until like I like re-evaluated mid back until like I like re-evaluated mid back until like I like re-evaluated mid to late January and it could be later to late January and it could be later to late January and it could be later than that so I'd say Haren Stein's than that so I'd say Haren Stein's than that so I'd say Haren Stein's pretty like value is pretty high I mean pretty like value is pretty high I mean pretty like value is pretty high I mean I don't know if you could put an exact I don't know if you could put an exact I don't know if you could put an exact number on it but the fact that you know number on it but the fact that you know number on it but the fact that you know he's not necessarily definitely G to be he's not necessarily definitely G to be he's not necessarily definitely G to be back in November or December um or like back in November or December um or like back in November or December um or like early December like he they might you early December like he they might you early December like he they might you know not want to rush him back if know not want to rush him back if know not want to rush him back if they're able to win games with this they're able to win games with this they're able to win games with this smaller lineup so I I say his value is smaller lineup so I I say his value is smaller lineup so I I say his value is definitely increased since chat went definitely increased since chat went definitely increased since chat went down but I can't say by how down but I can't say by how down but I can't say by how much yeah I don't know if I'd expect much yeah I don't know if I'd expect much yeah I don't know if I'd expect much more than like seventh round value much more than like seventh round value much more than like seventh round value in standard leagues it's because you we in standard leagues it's because you we in standard leagues it's because you we need to see how that lineup meshes need to see how that lineup meshes need to see how that lineup meshes together and how he plays off off of SGA together and how he plays off off of SGA together and how he plays off off of SGA and Jaylen Williams so I think middle and Jaylen Williams so I think middle and Jaylen Williams so I think middle round I think that's fair expectation round I think that's fair expectation round I think that's fair expectation for hartenstein once he gets his legs for hartenstein once he gets his legs for hartenstein once he gets his legs underneath underneath underneath him all right Sid ask better guy the him all right Sid ask better guy the him all right Sid ask better guy the roster for the next couple weeks Kevin roster for the next couple weeks Kevin roster for the next couple weeks Kevin herder or Isaiah Joe I think i' go red I think I'd go red Joe I think i' go red I think I'd go red Joe I think i' go red I think I'd go red velvet uh just because he's gonna be an velvet uh just because he's gonna be an velvet uh just because he's gonna be an unquestioned starter in terms of Isaiah unquestioned starter in terms of Isaiah unquestioned starter in terms of Isaiah Joe he's definitely playing rotation Joe he's definitely playing rotation Joe he's definitely playing rotation minutes but that fifth starter spots minutes but that fifth starter spots minutes but that fifth starter spots rotated almost by the game based on rotated almost by the game based on rotated almost by the game based on matchups either he Aaron Wiggins or Cas matchups either he Aaron Wiggins or Cas matchups either he Aaron Wiggins or Cas Wallace so I think he'll get his minutes Wallace so I think he'll get his minutes Wallace so I think he'll get his minutes but I think I would rather have herder but I think I would rather have herder but I think I would rather have herder roster as a starter being able to play roster as a starter being able to play roster as a starter being able to play off with those Playmakers and he's gonna off with those Playmakers and he's gonna off with those Playmakers and he's gonna I think he's gonna have no problem I think he's gonna have no problem I think he's gonna have no problem hitting or exceeding 30 minutes per hitting or exceeding 30 minutes per hitting or exceeding 30 minutes per night for these next few weeks while night for these next few weeks while night for these next few weeks while Malik is down yeah I was gonna say with Malik is down yeah I was gonna say with Malik is down yeah I was gonna say with Malik monk being down that definitely Malik monk being down that definitely Malik monk being down that definitely does help herder I think it helps Keon does help herder I think it helps Keon does help herder I think it helps Keon Ellis Moore even though both kind of Ellis Moore even though both kind of Ellis Moore even though both kind of sucked last night um I mean like they it sucked last night um I mean like they it sucked last night um I mean like they it was not because I remember I was was not because I remember I was was not because I remember I was messaging with somebody about whether messaging with somebody about

him anyways um he'll be recommending him anyways um he'll be recommending him anyways um he'll be fine but Isaiah Joe started in their fine but Isaiah Joe started in their fine but Isaiah Joe started in their last game but like you said it has been last game but like you said it has been last game but like you said it has been that kind of rotation and it wouldn't that kind of rotation and it wouldn't that kind of rotation and it wouldn't shock me if it continued to be a shock me if it continued to be a shock me if it continued to be a rotation he just rotated two spots rotation he just rotated two spots rotation he just rotated two spots instead of one just with ched out so instead of one just with ched out so instead of one just with ched out so does that mean maybe more starts for does that mean maybe more starts for does that mean maybe more starts for Isaiah Joe maybe but you know the only Isaiah Joe maybe but you know the only Isaiah Joe maybe but you know the only thing he's really consistently given is thing he's really consistently given is thing he's really consistently given is threes um so yeah I think herder's threes um so yeah I think herder's threes um so yeah I think herder's probably the safer option unless which probably the safer option unless which probably the safer option unless which we don't know if this is the case or not we don't know if this is the case or not we don't know if this is the case or not because even when everyone's healthy because even when everyone's healthy because even when everyone's healthy like Mark digal is not gonna announce like Mark digal is not gonna announce like Mark digal is not gonna announce his starting lineup here rotation his starting lineup here rotation his starting lineup here rotation earlier than he has to like 30 minutes earlier than he has to like 30 minutes earlier than he has to like 30 minutes before the game um so if Isaiah Joe before the game um so if Isaiah Joe before the game um so if Isaiah Joe continues to start I mean their last continues to start I mean their last continues to start I mean their last like last night 12 points three boards like last night 12 points three boards like last night 12 points three boards three assists three steals block two three assists three steals block two three assists three steals block two threes like I don't think we can expect threes like I don't think we can expect threes like I don't think we can expect that from him but if he starts doing that from him but if he starts doing that from him but if he starts doing things like that then yeah that'd be things like that then yeah that'd be things like that then yeah that'd be great but herder's a much safer op all right James asks what's the trade all right James asks what's the trade all right James asks what's the trade value for Jabari Smith Jr if value for Jabari Smith Jr if value for Jabari Smith Jr if any H sell low I guess I don't know I any H sell low I guess I don't know I any H sell low I guess I don't know I think he's a Buy Low guy at this point think he's a Buy Low guy at this point think he's a Buy Low guy at this point and even then that's a significant risk and even then that's a significant risk and even then that's a significant risk that you're taking just because it that you're taking just because it that you're taking just because it doesn't really seem like a good fit doesn't really seem like a good fit doesn't really seem like a good fit maybe he'd benefit from being moved to maybe he'd benefit from being moved to maybe he'd benefit from being moved to the bench being kind of one of the the bench being kind of one of the the bench being kind of one of the offensive focal points for the second offensive focal points for the second offensive focal points for the second unit it feels like he turns down a lot unit it feels like he turns down a lot unit it feels like he turns down a lot of opportunities within that offense you of opportunities within that offense you of opportunities within that offense you got shenon Jaylen green on the floor and got shenon Jaylen green on the floor and got shenon Jaylen green on the floor and Fred Van vet too so I think if there's a Fred Van vet too so I think if there's a Fred Van vet too so I think if there's a lineup change it may ultimately work in lineup change it may ultimately work in lineup change it may ultimately work in his favor if he would to be moved to the his favor if he would to be moved to the his favor if he would to be moved to the bench yeah I think that would I don't bench yeah I think that would I don't bench yeah I think that would I don't know if maybe it would help him I don't know if maybe it would help him I don't know if maybe it would

it's like guarantee that obviously right it's like I like it might but I think there's also I like it might but I think there's also I like it might but I think there's also just a fairly I don't know I meoka seems just a fairly I don't know I meoka seems just a fairly I don't know I meoka seems to be pretty loyal to his lineups to be pretty loyal to his lineups to be pretty loyal to his lineups doesn't seem like he's going to be like doesn't seem like he's going to be like doesn't seem like he's going to be like a guy that's going to change them unless a guy that's going to change them unless a guy that's going to change them unless he like really feels good about it he like really feels good about it he like really feels good about it so I don't know I think getting like so I don't know I think getting like so I don't know I think getting like losing out on minutes is probably more losing out on minutes is probably more losing out on minutes is probably more likely we we've seen him do that in the likely we we've seen him do that in the likely we we've seen him do that in the past with Jaylen green and uper shenon past with Jaylen green and uper shenon past with Jaylen green and uper shenon but the thing of it is is I don't think but the thing of it is is I don't think but the thing of it is is I don't think he's gonna do that with a guy that's he's gonna do that with a guy that's he's gonna do that with a guy that's playing good defense and even if he's playing good defense and even if he's playing good defense and even if he's not getting defensive numbers like Jabar not getting defensive numbers like Jabar not getting defensive numbers like Jabar Smith is a good Defender and that's what Smith is a good Defender and that's what Smith is a good Defender and that's what amoko wants amoko wants amoko wants so um kind of that's kind of like so um kind of that's kind of like so um kind of that's kind of like getting off on a tangent but as far as getting off on a tangent but as far as getting off on a tangent but as far as what his trade value is like he doesn't what his trade value is like he doesn't what his trade value is like he doesn't have much at this point and unless he have much at this point and unless he have much at this point and unless he just simply starts hitting more shots just simply starts hitting more shots just simply starts hitting more shots I'm not optimistic that he's going to be I'm not optimistic that he's going to be I'm not optimistic that he's going to be better than he already has been which I better than he already has been which I better than he already has been which I mean it'll it'll get better I don't mean it'll it'll get better I don't mean it'll it'll get better I don't imagine he's gonna shoot 25% from three imagine he's gonna shoot 25% from three imagine he's gonna shoot 25% from three for an entire season but I don't know for an entire season but I don't know for an entire season but I don't know how much better realistic expectations for Keon better realistic expectations for Keon better realistic expectations for Keon Ellis the next two weeks Ellis the next two weeks Ellis the next two weeks I mean I guess late round value would be I mean I guess late round value would be I mean I guess late round value would be realistic I don't not expecting much realistic I don't not expecting much realistic I don't not expecting much more from him you more from him you more from him you know yeah I think uh so this year he's know yeah I think uh so this year he's know yeah I think uh so this year he's averaging 0.9 threes point eight blocks averaging 0.9 threes point eight blocks averaging 0.9 threes point eight blocks and a steel and a half um I mean I could and a steel and a half um I mean I could and a steel and a half um I mean I could see him getting over one three over one see him getting over one three over one see him getting over one three over one block and I mean I would I don't want to block and I mean I would I don't want to block and I mean I would I don't want to say two steals but like 1.7 1.8 steals say two steals but like 1.7 1.8 steals say two steals but like 1.7 1.8 steals like those are the three categories that like those are the three categories that like those are the three categories that I think he can impact um now obviously I think he can impact um now obviously I think he can impact um now obviously last night he had one three and two last night he had one three and two last night he had one three and two steals in 23 minutes like it was a bad steals in 23 minutes like it was a bad steals in 23 minutes like it was a bad game for them all around so I think game for them all around so I think game for them all around so I think realistic would be yeah like late round realistic would be yeah like late round realistic would be yeah like late round value maybe borderline top 125 but he value maybe borderline top 125 but he value maybe borderline top 125 but he because he's able to make a really big because he's able to make a really big because he's able to make a really big impact with steals in blocks he could impact with steals in blocks he could impact with steals in blocks he could easily like that could easily look much easily like that could easily look much easily like that could easily look much better if he's getting back to what he better if he's getting back to what he better if he's getting back to what he did um I guess late last season when he did um I guess late last season when he did um I guess late last season when he was getting like pretty consistently was getting like pretty consistently was getting like pretty consistently five stocks a game yeah why is kuso's ownership percentage so why is kuso's ownership percentage so why is kuso's ownership percentage so high do you think his minutes or role high do you think his minutes or role high do you think his minutes or role increase as the season progresses I think uh it's probably high progresses I think uh it's probably high progresses I think uh it's probably high off name value like to answer the first off name value like to answer the first off name value like to answer the first question it's okay this guy has been question it's okay this guy has been question it's okay this guy has been very good in the past the Thunder are very good in the past the Thunder are very good in the past the Thunder are going to be good this year they acquired going to be good this year they acquired going to be good this year they acquired him like we kind of talked about for him like we kind of talked about for him like we kind of talked about for Josh giddy um and so you expect them to Josh giddy um and so you expect them to Josh giddy um and so you expect them to use him and that's why he was drafted a use him and that's why he was drafted a use him and that's why he was drafted a lot and I'm assuming it's still high lot and I'm assuming it's still high lot and I'm assuming it's still high because probably some leagues have because probably some leagues have because probably some leagues have already fallen off and they don't care already fallen off and they don't care already fallen off and they don't care to drop him or whatever um but as far as to drop him or whatever um but as far as to drop him or whatever um but as far as his minutes a role increasing as the his minutes a role increasing as the his minutes a role increasing as the season progresses I do think it will season progresses I do think it will season progresses I do think it will especially as we get closer to the especially as we get closer to the especially as we get closer to the playoffs um I'm not saying he's gonna playoffs um I'm not saying he's gonna playoffs um I'm not saying he's gonna get closer to 30 minutes per game but get closer to 30 minutes per game but get closer to 30 minutes per game but playing less than 20 to this point I playing less than 20 to this point I playing less than 20 to this point I expect that would go up and then expect that would go up and then expect that would go up and then probably actually during the playoffs I probably actually during the playoffs I probably actually during the playoffs I expect him to play a lot more like expect him to play a lot more like expect him to play a lot more like closer to 28 30 minutes per game like I closer to 28 30 minutes per game like I closer to 28 30 minutes per game like I get that they like Aaron Wiggins they get

opinion I Chris worthy of that in my opinion I Chris worthy of that in my opinion I Chris Middleton had both of his ankles Middleton had both of his ankles Middleton had both of his ankles operated on like I operated on like I operated on like I don't sounds like he's getting closer don't sounds like he's getting closer don't sounds like he's getting closer but I I don't trust a player in that but I I don't trust a player in that but I I don't trust a player in that type of injury situation to give you type of injury situation to give you type of injury situation to give you proper fantasy value so I think I would proper fantasy value so I think I would proper fantasy value so I think I would I would stash herb if you can afford it I would stash herb if you can afford it I would stash herb if you can afford it just because of the defensive potential just because of the defensive potential just because of the defensive potential especially if you have enough scoring on especially if you have enough scoring on especially if you have enough scoring on the rest of your roster too to to make the rest of your roster too to to make the rest of your roster too to to make up for any points you may lose going up for any points you may lose going up for any points you may lose going with her over with her over with her over Middleton yeah and I think we've seen Middleton yeah and I think we've seen Middleton yeah and I think we've seen you know Chris Middleton have a lot of you know Chris Middleton have a lot of you know Chris Middleton have a lot of obviously a lot of injury issues in the obviously a lot of injury issues in the obviously a lot of injury issues in the past we've also seen where he misses the past we've also seen where he misses the past we've also seen where he misses the start of the year he comes back and they start of the year he comes back and they start of the year he comes back and they play him 20 minutes per game they rest play him 20 minutes per game they rest play him 20 minutes per game they rest him back to back he misses more time him back to back he misses more time him back to back he misses more time like I don't I mean if I have nobody like I don't I mean if I have nobody like I don't I mean if I have nobody else to stash then sure I'll stash Chris else to stash then sure I'll stash Chris else to stash then sure I'll stash Chris Middleton just for the sake um but I Middleton just for the sake um but I Middleton just for the sake um but I would probably feel more comfortable would probably feel more comfortable would probably feel more comfortable stashing her Jones yeah I agree all all all right quick qu what's up guys what's up right quick qu what's up guys what's up right quick qu what's up guys what's up man quick question what do you guys man quick question what do you guys man quick question what do you guys think about kmer or D'Angelo Russell for think about kmer or D'Angelo Russell for think about kmer or D'Angelo Russell for a 201 points League who would be better a 201 points League who would be better a 201 points League who would be better throughout the season I think who's is just iffy just season I think who's is just iffy just season I think who's is just iffy just because like they might shut him down at because like they might shut him down at because like they might shut him down at some point um so I think it it kind of some point um so I think it it kind of some point um so I think it it kind of depends on your league settings with depends on your league settings with depends on your league settings with that as well um I assume that D'Angelo that as well um I assume that D'Angelo that as well um I assume that D'Angelo Russell will continue to play uh for the Russell will continue to play uh for the Russell will continue to play uh for the Lakers until the trade deadline and then Lakers until the trade deadline and then Lakers until the trade deadline and then I don't know because it already like I don't know because it already like I don't know because it already like he's been in trade rumors for years but he's been in trade rumors for years but he's been in trade rumors for years but it seems like maybe it would actually it seems like maybe it would actually it seems like maybe it would actually happen by the trade deadline this year happen by the trade deadline this year happen by the trade deadline this year in which case we have no idea where he in which case we have no idea where he in which case we have no idea where he would end up um would end up um would end up um so I mean it would depend on your point so I mean it would depend on your point so I mean it would depend on your point scoring settings I would assume that scoring settings I would assume that scoring settings I would assume that Cruz is the better option short term but Cruz is the better option short term but Cruz is the better option short term but I think over the course of the season I I think over the course of the season I I think over the course of the season I feel a little bit more comfortable with feel a little bit more comfortable with feel a little bit more comfortable with D'Angelo Russell just off the S I think D'Angelo Russell just off the S I think D'Angelo Russell just off the S I think he plays more he plays more he plays more games yeah I think that's fair kman just games yeah I think that's fair kman just games yeah I think that's fair kman just returned from injury um that demotion to returned from injury um that demotion to returned from injury um that demotion to the bench for the bench for the bench for Russell I don't know you understand why Russell I don't know you understand why Russell I don't know you understand why happen given the sequence that we happen given the sequence that we happen given the sequence that we watched n Grizzly's game last week but watched n Grizzly's game last week but watched n Grizzly's game last week but yeah I yeah I yeah I don't I don't I think kma you look at don't I don't I think kma you look at don't I don't I think kma you look at that roster they've got promising that roster they've got promising that roster they've got promising players who can play his position um so players who can play his position um so players who can play his position um so he's someone that I could see being a he's someone that I could see being a he's someone that I could see being a shutdown candidate after the trade shutdown candidate after the trade shutdown candidate after the trade deadline because this isn't going to be deadline because this isn't going to be deadline because this isn't going to be a playoff or playin team so I think I a playoff or playin team so I think I a playoff or playin team so I think I would go Russell but I don't really feel would go Russell but I don't really feel would go Russell but I don't really feel too good about that yeah and I think DLo too good about that yeah and I think DLo too good about that yeah and I think DLo has been pretty solid Off the Bench like has been pretty solid Off the Bench like has been pretty solid Off the Bench like yeah in the two games 18 23 and two yeah in the two games 18 23 and two yeah in the two games 18 23 and two threes and then 15 211 and three threes threes and then 15 211 and three threes threes and then 15 211 and three threes so I don't know maybe that's what he so I don't know maybe that's what he so I don't know maybe that's what he kind of needed like the numbers won't kind of needed like the numbers won't kind of needed like the numbers won't have quite the same upside as they did have quite the same upside as they did have quite the same upside as they did as a starter but almost like a reality as a starter but almost like a reality as a starter but almost like a reality check like oh like I get it now things check like oh like I get it now things check like oh like I get it now things like that can't happen like a little bit like that can't happen like a little bit like that can't happen like a little bit of a motivating thing so we'll see of a motivating thing so we'll see of a motivating thing so we'll see yeah all right with the Pelicans yeah all right with the Pelicans yeah all right with the Pelicans essentially having an emergency room for essentially having an emergency room for essentially having an emergency room for a roster what do your thought some a roster what do your thought some a roster what do your thought some players like javante green and jayen Noel Noel Noel um yeah I mean like I think that um yeah I mean like I think that um yeah I mean like I think that they're not super exciting or reliable they're not super exciting or reliable they're not super exciting or reliable streaming options but like we kind of streaming options but like we kind of streaming options but like we kind of said at the very beginning um you kind said at the very beginning um you kind said at the very beginning um you kind of have to or it's fine to stream of have to or it's fine to stream of have to or it's fine to stream anybody in New Orleans that's a healthy anybody in New Orleans that's a healthy anybody in New Orleans that's a healthy body yeah I don't I nothing to add to body yeah I don't I nothing to add to body yeah I don't I

roster they're not they've had on that roster they're not even what I think they're about 10 games even what I think they're about 10 games even what I think they're about 10 games in the season so yeah yeah all right in the season so yeah yeah all right in the season so yeah yeah all right another Pelicans question alberado Miss another Pelicans question alberado Miss another Pelicans question alberado Miss at least six weeks Brandon Boston Jr is at least six weeks Brandon Boston Jr is at least six weeks Brandon Boston Jr is going to eat will he somehow lead to going to eat will he somehow lead to going to eat will he somehow lead to opening a bigger long term role for opening a bigger long term role for opening a bigger long term role for Boston or will he disappear later I think uh I think he's kind of I later I think uh I think he's kind of I later I think uh I think he's kind of I it's an iffy one because it depends on it's an iffy one because it depends on it's an iffy one because it depends on what you mean by long-term role yeah if what you mean by long-term role yeah if what you mean by long-term role yeah if you're saying 25 to 30 minutes per game you're saying 25 to 30 minutes per game you're saying 25 to 30 minutes per game like that's just not going to happen like that's just not going to happen like that's just not going to happen when everybody's healthy and it's not a when everybody's healthy and it's not a when everybody's healthy and it's not a knock on him but it's the amount of knock on him but it's the amount of knock on him but it's the amount of money that they've invested in these money that they've invested in these money that they've invested in these very talented players um but I think very talented players um but I think very talented players um but I think what he's done could keep him sing 15 what he's done could keep him sing 15 what he's done could keep him sing 15 minutes per game but I guess you like minutes per game but I guess you like minutes per game but I guess you like it's kind of unreal how many because I it's kind of unreal how many because I it's kind of unreal how many because I mean Trey Murphy just now got back but mean Trey Murphy just now got back but mean Trey Murphy just now got back but Zion's still out and then dejon CJ Zion's still out and then dejon CJ Zion's still out and then dejon CJ McCullum Jordan Hawkins her like if the McCullum Jordan Hawkins her like if the McCullum Jordan Hawkins her like if the entire team somehow manages to be entire team somehow manages to be entire team somehow manages to be healthy at once I I think that Brandon healthy at once I I think that Brandon healthy at once I I think that Brandon Boston's probably like the ninth man Boston's probably like the ninth man Boston's probably like the ninth man yeah and do has he earned or played well yeah and do has he earned or played well yeah and do has he earned or played well enough for them to prioritize him over enough for them to prioritize him over enough for them to prioritize him over Jordan Hawkins the guy they just drafted Jordan Hawkins the guy they just drafted Jordan Hawkins the guy they just drafted in the first round a couple years like I in the first round a couple years like I in the first round a couple years like I guess it was two two years ago yeah yeah guess it was two two years ago yeah yeah guess it was two two years ago yeah yeah so I I don't think so but um so I could so I I don't think so but um so I could so I I don't think so but um so I could see him getting 10 to 15 minutes per see him getting 10 to 15 minutes per see him getting 10 to 15 minutes per game later in the season when the team's game later in the season when the team's game later in the season when the team's healthy but it's probably not enough to healthy but it's probably not enough to healthy but it's probably not enough to really impact fantasy this really impact fantasy this really impact fantasy this year yeah I think that's fair like he year yeah I think that's fair like he year yeah I think that's fair like he for bigger role for him given the career for bigger role for him given the career for bigger role for him given the career history it'll be like a back of the history it'll be like a back of the history it'll be like a back of the rotation you know sticking there so I rotation you know sticking there so I rotation you know sticking there so I don't really think that's going to be don't really think that's going to be don't really think that's going to be enough for Fantasy value but he's played enough for Fantasy value but he's played enough for Fantasy value but he's played well enough I think he can earn himself well enough I think he can earn

much of an it's really not going to have much of an it's really not going to have much of an impact impact impact yeah all right it's all about the bub yeah all right it's all about the bub yeah all right it's all about the bub Carrington bandwagon Carrington bandwagon Carrington bandwagon here parper asked two questions um Zack here parper asked two questions um Zack here parper asked two questions um Zack Ed or bub Carrington rest of the season Ed or bub Carrington rest of the season Ed or bub Carrington rest of the season n Cat head-to-head and then Payton n Cat head-to-head and then Payton n Cat head-to-head and then Payton Pritchard or bub Pritchard or bub Pritchard or bub Carrington jesz tough ones yeah those Carrington jesz tough ones yeah those Carrington jesz tough ones yeah those are difficult ones for sure um I would I are difficult ones for sure um I would I are difficult ones for sure um I would I would hold Edie just because I think his would hold Edie just because I think his would hold Edie just because I think his role starting to expand a bit in terms role starting to expand a bit in terms role starting to expand a bit in terms of how many minutes he plays of how many minutes he plays of how many minutes he plays um and he's going to be a starter down um and he's going to be a starter down um and he's going to be a starter down there in Memphis so I think I would go there in Memphis so I think I would go there in Memphis so I think I would go with him as for Pritchard or bub oh man I think I would lean lean lean B that's a really tough one because it's B that's a really tough one because it's B that's a really tough one because it's not like pit is going to drop out of the not like pit is going to drop out of the not like pit is going to drop out of the rotation once p zus returns and that's rotation once p zus returns and that's rotation once p zus returns and that's not going to that may not happen till not going to that may not happen till not going to that may not happen till December or January so you'll have a bit December or January so you'll have a bit December or January so you'll have a bit of a Runway to establish him further and of a Runway to establish him further and of a Runway to establish him further and then after Chris STS returns you also then after Chris STS returns you also then after Chris STS returns you also have the Al Horford back-to-back factor have the Al Horford back-to-back factor have the Al Horford back-to-back factor to consider too so I think those are all to consider too so I think those are all to consider too so I think those are all really good questions I think with any really good questions I think with any really good questions I think with any rookie in a rebuild you're kind of rookie in a rebuild you're kind of rookie in a rebuild you're kind of worried about the efficiency stats but I worried about the efficiency stats but I worried about the efficiency stats but I think bub has been solid in that regard think bub has been solid in that regard think bub has been solid in that regard this far so that's a really good this far so that's a really good this far so that's a really good question I'd lean bub but I would not question I'd lean bub but I would not question I'd lean bub but I would not have a a beef of anyone who said have a a beef of anyone who said have a a beef of anyone who said Pritchard yeah I think if these are the Pritchard yeah I think if these are the Pritchard yeah I think if these are the three you're deciding between then three you're deciding between then three you're deciding between then you're in a pretty good spot I mean if you're in a pretty good spot I mean if you're in a pretty good spot I mean if it's you did a good job drafting

of make put up recently almost kind of make people forget what type of player he is people forget what type of player he is people forget what type of player he is or what he was like the expectation was or what he was like the expectation was or what he was like the expectation was that if this guy's gonna be playing in that if this guy's gonna be playing in that if this guy's gonna be playing in the league it's just because he can get the league it's just because he can get the league it's just because he can get Buckets and like that's what he's gonna Buckets and like that's what he's gonna Buckets and like that's what he's gonna do and you know a lot of times guys like do and you know a lot of times guys like do and you know a lot of times guys like that are inconsistent and have some very that are inconsistent and have some very that are inconsistent and have some very atrocious shooting nights and because atrocious shooting nights and because atrocious shooting nights and because they they literally professional scores they they literally professional scores they they literally professional scores they're going to continue to shoot um they're going to continue to shoot um they're going to continue to shoot um but I think what like I said I think but I think what like I said I think but I think what like I said I think this a little bit earlier I mean we've this a little bit earlier I mean we've this a little bit earlier I mean we've talked about the Pelicans half the time talked about the Pelicans half the time talked about the Pelicans half the time which is fine but um like he's doing which is fine but um like he's doing which is fine but um like he's doing things other than scoring which I think things other than scoring which I think things other than scoring which I think like encourages me as far as how like encourages me as far as how like encourages me as far as how valuable he can be in fantasy uh until valuable he can be in fantasy uh until valuable he can be in fantasy uh until everybody gets healthy so I'm not too everybody gets healthy so I'm not too everybody gets healthy so I'm not too concerned about some poor shooting concerned about some poor shooting concerned about some poor shooting nights especially when he's probably the nights especially when he's probably the nights especially when he's probably the second best uh Trey Murphy's back the second best uh Trey Murphy's back the second best uh Trey Murphy's back the third best scoring option on the team third best scoring option on the team third best scoring option on the team right now it's a very different role for right now it's a very different role for right now it's a very different role for him yeah that's a good point him yeah that's a good point him yeah that's a good point um sorry about that but yeah I think um sorry about that but yeah I think um sorry about that but yeah I think he's shooting 46% from the field right he's shooting 46% from the field right he's shooting 46% from the field right now so it's not like he's been bad in now so it's not like he's been bad in now so it's not like he's been bad in that regard just had a bad game that regard just had a bad game that regard just had a bad game basically so I think he'll be fine basically so I think he'll be fine basically so I think he'll be fine um yeah I think he's certainly someone um yeah I think he's certainly someone um yeah I think he's certainly someone you have to have roster at this point you have to have roster at this point you have to have roster at this point given the state of that roster given the state of that roster given the state of that roster when is Nick Richards expected back is when is Nick Richards expected back is when is Nick Richards expected back is he worth a he worth a he worth a stash now last week when they announced stash now last week when they announced stash now last week when they announced that he had the rib fracture he was that he had the rib fracture he was that he had the rib fracture he was announced that he'd be eval reevaluated announced that he'd be eval reevaluated announced that he'd be eval reevaluated in two weeks so You' got at least in two weeks so You' got at least in two weeks so You' got at least another week to wait there then after another week to wait there then after another week to wait there then after that it's about okay progress made and that it's about okay progress made and that it's about okay progress made and also conditioning too so I think if also conditioning too so I think if also conditioning too so I think if you're thinking positively about this you're thinking positively about this you're thinking positively about this I'd say about two weeks total before he I'd say about two weeks total before he I'd say about two weeks total before he gets back but Charlotte's been notorious gets back but Charlotte's been notorious gets back but Charlotte's been notorious about how they really haven't been too about how they really haven't been too about how they really haven't been too forthcoming with the injury related forthcoming with the injury related forthcoming with the injury related information so I think he's worth a information so I think he's worth a information so I think he's worth a stash just because we don't know when stash just because we don't know when stash just because we don't know when Mark Williams is going to play either so Mark Williams is going to play either so Mark Williams is going to play either so it seems that Richards may be closer to it seems that Richards may be closer to it seems that Richards may be closer to a return than Williams so IID probably a return than Williams so IID probably a return than Williams so IID probably stash him if you can afford to do stash him if you can afford to do stash him if you can afford to do so yeah I agree because like you said so yeah I agree because like you said so yeah I agree because like you said the re-evaluation datee would be a week the re-evaluation datee would be a week the re-evaluation datee would be a week from yesterday yeah and then you know it from yesterday yeah and then you know it from yesterday yeah and then you know it might be later that week might be might be later that week might be might be later that week might be another week it could be three months another week it could be three months another week it could be three months who knows it's Charlotte so they we're who knows it's Charlotte so they we're who knows it's Charlotte so they we're not we're not confident that this is an not we're not confident that this is an not we're not confident that this is an accurate timeline um just because of accurate timeline um just because of accurate timeline um just because of what we've seen in the past now could he what we've seen in the past now could he what we've seen in the past now could he be back soon sure um but I think he is be back soon sure um but I think he is be back soon sure um but I think he is worth stashing because I I am confident worth stashing because I I am confident worth stashing because I I am confident that he plays this season before or that he plays this season before or that he plays this season before or plays again before Mark Williams returns plays again before Mark Williams returns plays again before Mark Williams returns I have zero clue and I don't think I have zero clue and I don't think I have zero clue and I don't think anybody has any clue as to when Mark anybody has any clue as to when Mark anybody has any clue as to when Mark Williams is going to be back okay Noah Clowny flashed his upside last okay Noah Clowny flashed his upside last okay Noah Clowny

think I should do with what do you guys think I should do with what do you guys think I should do with Norman pal I think I would pal I think I would pal I think I would hold because I know it doesn't feel hold because I know it doesn't feel hold because I know it doesn't feel realistic in terms of season long value realistic in terms of season long value realistic in terms of season long value but as we discussed earlier we don't but as we discussed earlier we don't but as we discussed earlier we don't know when or if Kawhi Leonard will play know when or if Kawhi Leonard will play know when or if Kawhi Leonard will play basketball this season so I would hold basketball this season so I would hold basketball this season so I would hold Norman Norman Norman pal I uh I wouldn't I I'd try and

very good I don't think that's going to slow down but I feel more confident or slow down but I feel more confident or slow down but I feel more confident or comfortable with somebody else that's comfortable with somebody else that's comfortable with somebody else that's close by him in rankings now that's close by him in rankings now that's close by him in rankings now that's probably not going to work with a probably not going to work with a probably not going to work with a onetoone trade like I just for example onetoone trade like I just for example onetoone trade like I just for example Jaylen Williams and Luka donic are the Jaylen Williams and Luka donic are the Jaylen Williams and Luka donic are the next two after him like I I don't think next two after him like I I don't think next two after him like I I don't think that somebody would trade you either of that somebody would trade you either of that somebody would trade you either of those guys for Norm pal so it's it's an those guys for Norm pal so it's it's an those guys for Norm pal so it's it's an interesting one I don't know exactly interesting one I don't know exactly interesting one I don't know exactly what name I would be looking for but I what name I would be looking for but I what name I would be looking for but I would be trying to sell high if I can would be trying to sell high if I can would be trying to sell high if I can fair enough I tend to be hesitant to fair enough I tend to be hesitant to fair enough I tend to be hesitant to sell high on guys like I need to get sell high on guys like I need to get sell high on guys like I need to get yeah I know I'm always worried about yeah I know I'm always worried about yeah I know I'm always worried about what happens if I trade them and they what happens if I trade them and they what happens if I trade them and they continue to blow up continue to blow up continue to blow up but yeah I think this one this one's but yeah I think this one this one's but yeah I think this one this one's interesting because he is like an older interesting because he is like an older interesting because he is like an older prospect it's not like or Prospect he's prospect it's not like or Prospect he's prospect it's not like or Prospect he's an older player um so it's not like he's an older player um so it's not like he's an older player um so it's not like he's a 23y old that's having a breakout a 23y old that's having a breakout a 23y old that's having a breakout season and S high season and S high season and S high so I don't know it's so I don't know it's so I don't know it's I think kawai's return would limit him I I think kawai's return would limit him I I think kawai's return would limit him I think that there's a chance that he just think that there's a chance that he just think that there's a chance that he just his percentages drop a little bit and his percentages drop a little bit and his percentages drop a little bit and his ranking takes a dramatic hit but I his ranking takes a dramatic hit but I his ranking takes a dramatic hit but I also don't think anybody's going to also don't think anybody's going to also don't think anybody's going to trade you a a true second round value trade you a a true second round value trade you a a true second round value for him so it's you probably are just for him so it's you probably are just for him so it's you probably are just going to end up having to write it out going to end up having to write it out going to end up having to write it out because anybody that would
